00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,190
blocking the Silk Road and
broadcasting live from

opportunity's own 33 here in the
frontier of Austin, Texas

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,730
capital of the drone stars thing
in the morning, everybody. I'm

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,300
Adam Curry,

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,200
from Northern Silicon Valley
where it's never too late to

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,470
remind everybody. You can always
start journaling.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,090
journaling for fun and profit.
Oh, man. We got a red alert

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,340
today. Red Alert. Red Alert. Red
Alert.

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,500
What's the Red Alert? Chinese

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,320
are everywhere The Chinese are
coming. The Chinese are here

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,800
everywhere. We

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,490
know that

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,720
they're taking over. Oh, yeah. I
am enjoying the show everything

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,340
China this morning now exposed
worldwide.

19
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,360
Who's the guy who did that
little jiggle force? Download

20
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:10,140
did this and Wow. I can't get to
tune. So subs, China. I love

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,320
China. There's a we have a
jingle here.

22
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,460
I've left China, I don't know.
We'll have to we need it. We

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,470
need a china jingle. Because now
we have breaking news coming out

24
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,850
of Australia, home to one of our
Five Eyes friends. So

25
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,220
tonight, I sat with some
breaking news that will be

26
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,310
fanpage of the Australian
tomorrow. And big news in the UK

27
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,130
as well, amid rising tensions in
the Australia China

28
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,480
relationship. There is now been
a major leak of official records

29
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,120
from the Chinese Communist
Party, it is believed to be the

30
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,020
first leak of its kind in the
world register with the details

31
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,850
of nearly 2 million Communist
Party members includes the name,

32
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,960
party position, birthdate,
National ID number, ethnicity,

33
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,020
and in some cases, even their
phone number. What's amazing

34
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,380
about this database is not just
that it exposes people who are

35
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,230
members of the Communist Party,
and who are now living and

36
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,370
working all over the world from
Australia to us. Okay. But it's

37
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,820
amazing because because it lifts
the lid on how the party

38
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,570
operates.

39
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,560
So this came in this morning,
and I immediately sent out

40
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,120
messages like Hey, what's going
on? And what I got back was, oh,

41
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,950
if you're going to send me a
message about a list, at least

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,220
send the list. Oh, wait, here I
have it for you. This list is

43
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,710
it's like 10 megabytes. I put it
in the show notes. And up in it.

44
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,100
It's hosted on Git lab. And
apparently there's a way to

45
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,680
translate from the characters.

46
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,240
Yeah, no, there is.

47
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,150
I wasn't able to find it that
early or this this morning. But

48
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,570
there are apparently Biden
administration members in there.

49
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:01,740
And this is the part that is too
funny. Biden administration

50
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,580
members are listed in this
database, as well as and I think

51
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,260
this is probably more egregious
many and up to 75,000 across the

52
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,070
world, who are not in China,
many of them in the US and in

53
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,370
companies. And they have their
own little little little fiefdom

54
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,210
set up inside these companies.
So here's the waiting for this.

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,270
You know what this is, you know
what this is a result of Right.

56
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,480
I mean, you're where this stems
from? This is this is the part

57
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,830
of the Trump strategy,

58
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,870
I think, no, this is this is the
CIA's get back policy. Remember

59
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,930
that about two years ago with,
like, 20 or 30?

60
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,790
Yeah, yes. murdered? murdered?
Yes.

61
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,960
12. Okay. 12 are murdered. Yeah.
This is what this is what this

62
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,580
is? Well,

63
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,220
I would want to agree the the
issue I have is that this hack

64
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,450
is not new. This occurred quite
some time ago. I'm talking like,

65
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,420
what was it after the 12?
killed? CIA?

66
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,400
Yes, yes. It was after the was
that 2012? I think it was right.

67
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:06,390
It

68
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,660
was during It was during Obama
were like 14, but it was during,

69
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,510
during Obama. Yeah. So yes,
definitely after that. But for

70
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,380
this all of a sudden to come
now. I think it's just part of a

71
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,680
whole bunch of things that are
coming. And of course, he we

72
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,200
didn't get to talk about it on
on Thursday show. But the best

73
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,670
part, the best part of the China
link news has got to be hunter

74
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,740
Biden's laptop, which suddenly
is now news again, and they're

75
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:44,100
headed mainly by Fox. And I
think that fox news. They're

76
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,070
probably choosing a side here
like they don't want any

77
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,220
implication that they might be
involved with some kind of China

78
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,390
and this is their way of maybe
attacking their rivals in the in

79
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,410
the cable news business. But
here's senator Holly. Well, we

80
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,600
need to get to the bottom of
what exactly is on here with

81
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,230
hunter Biden. And

82
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:01,890
by the way, I

83
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,980
hope an apology will be
forthcoming from the Biden

84
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,730
campaign. And from Facebook and
Twitter and all these people who

85
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,010
censored The New York Post turns
out, guess what the New York

86
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,130
Post was right. Hunter Biden is
under investigation for money

87
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,040
laundering for tax fraud and
involves his Chinese business

88
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,920
dealings I want to know is Joe
Biden involves What?

89
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,350
Hunter was traveling to China on
a government plane in order to

90
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,500
try to seek out business? Now
he's under investigation for

91
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,830
federal crimes for this? What
did Joe Biden know? And when did

92
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,590
he know what he needs to answer
questions? All of these things

93
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:41,250
fold in so nicely, that I wonder
this could also be a nice push

94
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,370
from an IF and that would make
sense for Fox News. The

95
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,970
Democrats who run Fox News, it
would make a lot of sense

96
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,110
because they want Joe out. They
want to have komla have her

97
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,600
being the sock puppet of Obama
third.

98
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,570
That would be ideal.

99
00:05:57,989 --> 00:05:59,909
I think that's what they're
pushing for.

100
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:05,729
Well, maybe guy I do have
related to the punter thing. I

101
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:09,059
do have some super cuts that I
think are important. Okay,

102
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:10,919
I have a few of those. Well,
what do you got?

103
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:15,839
I got shoot, I got to have this
on the same seven just on a on

104
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,579
100. Biden's laptop when when
some of the before the laptop

105
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:24,269
was released. I but there was
all these innuendo. There's a

106
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:27,119
lot of news about hunter being
involved in all this criminal

107
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:30,389
activity. And so you ended up
with this super cut. This is

108
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,379
super cut a

109
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,670
Oh, okay.

110
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:36,119
I just want to deal, in fact,
because there is so much

111
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:38,579
speculation out there and there
is zero evidence

112
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,400
that hunter Biden or Joe Biden
did anything wrong here.

113
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,990
There is no evidence that Joe
Biden was you know, involved in

114
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,830
anyone, of course,

115
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,620
what to note that there is no
evidence that Joe Biden or

116
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,360
hunter Biden has done anything
wrong. I

117
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,880
just want to reiterate and let's
be clear for the viewers. There

118
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,330
is no

119
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,760
evidence Biden did anything
wrong. I'll

120
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,380
note again, because it's
important, there

121
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,200
is no I repeat, no, there is no

122
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,090
evidence that either Biden did
anything illegal.

123
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,310
There's been no evidence, there
was no evidence. There's

124
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,830
no evidence, there is no
evidence. There is not an iota

125
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,610
of evidence, no

126
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,260
evidence finding anything wrong.

127
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,080
Joe Biden did anything wrong.

128
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:18,119
Nobody's ever accused him that
there's no

129
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,360
wrong. Joe Biden did nothing
wrong. Hunter Biden did nothing

130
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:24,900
wrong.

131
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,050
So this is great, because now
you get everybody you also

132
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,320
skewer all the media and notice
Fox isn't in there.

133
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:38,670
I'm not sure. But, Dan, we have
supercut B which is after they

134
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,410
found a laptop with all the
evidence that they didn't have

135
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,170
any of this evidence before. Now
they got the evidence and here's

136
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:46,890
what they did.

137
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,730
Biden secret emails are really
fishy stories. The post claimed

138
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,140
that the emails were found

139
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,050
on a laptop computer that was
brought to a repair shop in

140
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:55,680
Delaware in

141
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,790
the spring of 2019.

142
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,040
The FBI is now investigating
whether those alleged hunter

143
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,070
Biden emails are actually
connected to a larger foreign

144
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,420
intelligence operation

145
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,780
they may be related to a foreign
intelligence operation

146
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,660
foreign intelligence operation
foreign

147
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,300
intelligence, foreign
intelligence for an intelligence

148
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,180
operation. For all we know these
emails are made up

149
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,080
the information found on the
laptop may be part of a Russian

150
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,550
disinformation campaign

151
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,640
of a Russian disinformation
efforts

152
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,490
described by many intelligence
experts as having hallmarks all

153
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,460
the harmar hallmarks rather all
the hallmarks of a Russian or

154
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,140
Russian Russian disinformation,

155
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,780
Russian disinformation
misinformation campaigns is a

156
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,970
classic example of the right
wing media.

157
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,800
Scott Adams made a really big
stink about this, he feels that

158
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,890
it's incredibly scary and an
outrage that over 50 of our

159
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:53,310
current and former intelligence
officials and specialists would

160
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,750
lie. As you know, they they
signed that letter Oh, no, this

161
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,560
looks like classic Russian
disinformation. Scott somehow

162
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,580
was a surprised by that and be
somewhat taken aback.

163
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,750
Why doesn't realize that half of
these guys are Democrats. And

164
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,960
then the clips the third one,
which is says three instead of

165
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,730
see. I think this is after all
that Russian intelligence,

166
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,450
intelligence, intelligence.
Here's the head of the DNI, the

167
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,660
actual intelligence. Hearing
this he has to come out and make

168
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,660
a statement. Don't drag the
intelligence community into this

169
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,270
Hunter. Biden's laptop is not
part of some Russian

170
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,970
disinformation campaign. the
intelligence community doesn't

171
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,690
believe that because there's no
intelligence that supports that.

172
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:38,910
Yeah.

173
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,340
Now it's, it's very interesting
also to see who is in the

174
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,040
limelight and talking about it,
because this this really now

175
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,480
comes down to it's really more
about China that the laptop is

176
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,290
not even being discussed in
regards to Ukraine. Oh, no, no,

177
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,650
no, it's China and you wait to
see who's gonna show up on this

178
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,290
list. Once that gets a little
bit of traction, which I'm sure

179
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,970
it will, after all, it's going
to the Daily News. Who we're not

180
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,410
seeing is the megalomaniacs like
Adam Schiff. He's nowhere to be

181
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,840
seen. Which is noteworthy, but
Oh, yeah.

182
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,050
But that guy's into it up to his
knees. Well,

183
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,650
I think someone else who all of
a sudden pops up onto the scene.

184
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:28,350
And I believe that this guy was
involved with the dissemination

185
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:37,080
of the Russian or the, the
dossier, the PP dossier, because

186
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,900
he was working hand in glove
with Jeb Bush. And so now to see

187
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,990
Marco Rubio all of a sudden pop
out and excoriate swalwell. You

188
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,110
know, listen to it in the
context of what were you really

189
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,680
doing a whole because I don't
trust Rubio at all. And why all

190
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,490
of a sudden, Is he out there
talking? Because this is a much

191
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,590
assess by yourself. Would you
cook to the health?

192
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,530
I think, first of all, the
tremendous irony, right? Yes,

193
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,610
yes. There you go. He's just
saying, the irony of you be

194
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,860
talking about the story of Marco
Rubio.

195
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,220
And I think this is an example.
I mean, you know, he's now

196
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,220
claiming that he wants to be
treated fairly, but he, as a

197
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,260
member of the Intelligence
Committee was going around

198
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,020
telling people that the
President was an agent of a

199
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,920
foreign government.

200
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,280
And obviously, when people hear
that from someone who's on the

201
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,780
Intelligence Committee,

202
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,330
they think he must know
something, he must know

203
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,910
something the rest of us don't
know when in fact, that's became

204
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,920
a habit from a lot of people
that will go around saying,

205
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,320
well, there's things you don't
know that we can't tell you, but

206
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,470
it's bad. So a lot of that stuff
was going on, it was very unfair

207
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,020
to the President. I think in
hindsight, we see that it was

208
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,470
all not true. And so I think you
can't go around behaving that

209
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,600
way, and then expect that you're
going to enjoy the benefits.

210
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:48,900
Notice

211
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,680
how he says, in hindsight, I
guess it wasn't true, after he

212
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,470
was probably peddling some of
that misinformation.

213
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,140
So a lot of that stuff was going
on, it was very unfair to the

214
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,540
President. I think, in
hindsight, we see that it was

215
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,990
all not true. And so I think you
can't go around behaving that

216
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,210
way, and then expect that you're
gonna enjoy the benefit of the

217
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,070
download. Look, there are
legitimate questions. I'm not

218
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,950
accusing anyone of anything. It
is perhaps exactly the way he

219
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,260
says, and I hope he takes up
your invitation to come on and

220
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,530
explain it. But the broader
question here is there are a lot

221
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,050
of legitimate questions that I
think are important to answer,

222
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,080
just as a member of Congress to
his constituency, but in the

223
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,570
house, and he wants to continue
to serve in this important role.

224
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,240
And I'm not saying he doesn't
have good answers. I don't know.

225
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,840
But, but there is a tremendous
amount of irony here, obviously.

226
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,870
So here's the Yeah.

227
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,790
Now, was swalwell taken off the
Intelligence Committee committee

228
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,190
immediately after this was
disclosed? Not

229
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,910
yet. No, I think he's still a
wire. Well, you should have been

230
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,720
taken off immediately. Yeah. But
that's, that's all he's been.

231
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,680
This is a problem that no one
knows how to deal with it. And

232
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,260
he's pushing it ahead, pushing
it out of the way. Like, let's

233
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,260
just see if we can keep moving
forward without dealing with it.

234
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,990
Although I also, you know, you
there was the

235
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,760
leadership is that,

236
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,050
well, they're weeding it out. So
die. Dianne Feinstein, also, who

237
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,460
also has a china problem.

238
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,760
You don't need to take a cop off
the beat immediately put them at

239
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,760
a desk, you find something else
for him to do you don't leave

240
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,430
them on the Intelligence
Committee, whereas he has secret

241
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,060
access to or classified access
to all kinds of material.

242
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,870
No, my What are you expecting? I
will run government. Please.

243
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,580
Please,

244
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,610
yes. Haha. No, no,

245
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,230
no, this is no good.

246
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,210
Yeah, so I don't know why that
hasn't. But we we can only

247
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,520
surmise why that hasn't
happened. But there's an attack,

248
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:47,490
Dianne Feinstein is is also out.
She's being pushed out. What was

249
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,750
the article in The New Yorker, I
think, big article about how she

250
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:57,150
senile Chuck Schumer calling her
out. And she's she's confused

251
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,540
now. So we got to get rid of
her. And you've got to wonder

252
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,600
how does someone like that get
reelected? If if it's such

253
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,210
common knowledge that she
doesn't have all of her

254
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,380
faculties together?

255
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,460
She got reelected?

256
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,820
No. How can she get reelected?

257
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,990
She can get reelected? No, no,
California for God's sake. Yeah.

258
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,220
Yeah. Let's see who's on the
ballot. Feinstein democrat click

259
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,910
i-man.

260
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,070
And while we're on that, how
sincere is Kamala Harris and

261
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,850
being the vice president elect,
seeing as she still has not

262
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,260
given a percentage seat? Don't
you have to do that eventually,

263
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,460
isn't there? Isn't there?

264
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,380
Ever thought of that one?

265
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,990
Isn't there a time where you
have to kind of consider doing

266
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,470
that so

267
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,170
that you know about this? I have
an idea. Yeah.

268
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,460
Keep it.

269
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,610
Do Yeah. Why not? Is there a
rule you can't be a senator and

270
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,630
a vice president.

271
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,890
I don't know of a rule like
that. Maybe some we must have

272
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,500
somebody who's a constitutional
lawyer. That might give us some

273
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,330
insight but I'd say Just keep
it. Why not? What is the vice

274
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,570
president do most of the time?
Nothing? Does she could be in

275
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,920
the senate doing some work?
Well, the thinking is that this

276
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,070
current, right, you have to vote
says, Ah, no, she's gonna have

277
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,520
to quit.

278
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,270
You can't have two votes. You
can't have a vote in the Senate

279
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,800
and then be the deciding vote.
Right. But still, it's kind of

280
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,760
protocol that when you call
yourself the vice president

281
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,460
elect that you then give up your
senate seat so that they can

282
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,300
figure out who's gonna take
over. This is interesting that

283
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,820
she hasn't done that yet. I
don't know if that's it's an

284
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,480
oversight.

285
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,600
Well, or maybe she's going back
to my thesis that she can have

286
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:45,570
two jobs. Yeah, if the if the
republicans win the one of those

287
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,760
two seats in Georgia, which
you're probably going to do,

288
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,090
then she could do two jobs,
because she's not going to be

289
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,050
the head of the Senate.

290
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,580
Right. Okay. Yeah. So maybe
she's waiting for that. That

291
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,280
would make sense. I mean, she's
not gonna be a tie breaker Is

292
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,090
this right? Or maybe she could
be in the stance, she still is

293
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:07,110
the head of the Senate. I want
to know, she's probably working

294
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,080
it out with their lawyers. I
keep both jobs if I were her

295
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,610
back to China for a moment
foxnews pushing the China

296
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,090
intelligentsia meme as hard as
they can, I think kind of the,

297
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,320
if there's any plan or strategy,
it's like, Alright, you know,

298
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,070
we're just gonna do all this
China stuff cuz it hedges us

299
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,250
like if Trump does something and
still kind of prevails, we've

300
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,910
still been against it, number
one enemy. And also, look what's

301
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,640
happening. Everyone's talking
about China, and it's gonna make

302
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:40,380
all these other networks look
bad. And know that sky Australia

303
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,280
who broke this, the Daily Mail
and all these, these are all

304
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,250
Murdoch properties. Wall Street
Journal has a big story on it

305
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,790
this morning. So Murdoch is
probably the Murdock's are

306
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,620
probably in it for themselves.
And likely, whatever faction of

307
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,760
the Democratic Democratic Party
is, is not compromised, would

308
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,130
like to have some of these
people exposed as well,

309
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,560
thinking. But fox is pushing it
as anything we can get about

310
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,820
China, and brought in as
relevant and as relevant. I like

311
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:16,620
rebel news seems pretty good.
stuff that they do up there. The

312
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,530
good and Ezra had broken the
story earlier, which we didn't

313
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:24,420
get to on Thursday, about the
Kanda navy and military training

314
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,770
the Chinese military and this
being at the direct order of

315
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,940
Justin Trudeau. So he went on
Tucker and explained it.

316
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,750
I read this, my first reaction
was this cannot be true. Your

317
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,860
Prime Minister offered to train
Chinese troops in Canada. Why

318
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,640
would he do that?

319
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:47,070
It's a shock to Canadians to
that cold weather warfare that

320
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:52,170
you're referring to was just one
of 18 different joint projects

321
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,680
the Canadian Armed Forces had
with the People's Liberation

322
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:02,730
Army in 2019. Alone, Canada is
training one and two star

323
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:07,140
Chinese generals in our war
colleges were chain training

324
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,400
lieutenants and majors,
commanders. We're sending

325
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,570
Canadians over to China, we're
bringing Chinese, I think

326
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,600
they're not just soldiers.
They're spies as well, to

327
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,660
Canada. And I don't know a
single person in this country

328
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,580
who knew about it, but it's been
happening. And we found out

329
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,660
about it really by accident.
When the government sent me

330
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,020
freedom of information
documents, and forgot to black

331
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,600
them out. Or maybe frankly,
someone inside the government

332
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:41,010
wanted to blow the whistle on
this incredibly upside down

333
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,070
relationship. In those same
memos. You're talking about?

334
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,420
Trudeau, his office was
supporting China and condemning

335
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,990
the Trump administration, it was
upside down. It was inverted

336
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,290
morality. It's seeping all the
way into our bureaucracy, our

337
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,410
diplomacy, and they're trying to
get the military on side too.

338
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:04,710
I love this. This is this is so
interesting that all of this

339
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,310
pops up now, right at this very
moment when there's certainly

340
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,970
plenty of other things to talk
about, but also know that the

341
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,690
Trump administration or Trudeau
about the Chinese infiltrators

342
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,500
and spies.

343
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,560
Well, in fact, in these memos,
you can see that the Trump

344
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,880
administration warned Canada
that this winter warfare

345
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,480
training would transfer
knowledge to China that could be

346
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,240
used now they don't explain
would it be used to take on

347
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,890
wiggers in shinjang Tibetans to
fight India in the Himalayas or

348
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,820
even a fight us. And when the
military the Canadian military

349
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,360
said our American allies are our
allies are concerned about this.

350
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,480
Trudeau staff pushed back and
said, Is it just the Trump

351
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,600
administration? Or is anyone
else worried about it? So

352
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,140
there's an antipathy towards
America that seeps through all

353
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,910
these secret documents, and the
overarching goal is to let

354
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,930
China's President Xi Jinping
save face I want to tell you

355
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,990
though, Tucker, that is not the
view shared by grassroots

356
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,590
Canadians ever since trying to
kidnap those two civilians two

357
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,860
years ago today, actually,
Canadian public opinion has

358
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,880
hardened against China and the
last Pew poll I saw actually

359
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,050
says that Canadians are more
hostile to try and win American

360
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:19,410
Farm.

361
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,740
All right, Canada navion
brothers and sisters are going

362
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,570
to help us out fight the China
man.

363
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,420
You're gonna help us step by
what reelecting Trudeau again.

364
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,900
Fight the China man, you know,
we

365
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,970
can listen to my wife moan and
groan about Jay Inslee, the

366
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,930
idiot governor up in? Yeah,
Washington keeps making these

367
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,650
edicts, the most recent of which
was no singing.

368
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:55,320
And like, he won by a landslide
up there. He went by a

369
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,450
landslide. What do you bitching
about?

370
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,970
What is the singing have to do
with it then?

371
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,700
Oh, because singing transmits
COVID.

372
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,280
Right. And what does that have
to do with him winning by a

373
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,090
landslide?

374
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,150
Oh, no, I'm just saying when you
bitch about somebody that you

375
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,060
keep voting in office, and I
would say Trudeau falls into

376
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,180
this category. Yes. You don't
have a lot of complaining to do

377
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:15,600
now.

378
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:26,130
As it turns out, the Democratic
National Party had Fang Fang on

379
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:26,850
the payroll.

380
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,240
Fang Fang, who did the bang
bang? Yes.

381
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:36,150
taking her 12 $174 by bi weekly.

382
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,990
She's double dipping in more
ways than one.

383
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:46,530
Yes. I love these stories. It's
just like, are we completely

384
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,800
infiltrated by the Chinese
Communist Party? Well, it sure

385
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,480
seems that way. And I think it's
intended to make you feel that

386
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,500
way. But it may not even be that
far off. I love the Did you see

387
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,140
the trader trading cards that
are going around? Now? These are

388
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:01,770
cool. Yeah,

389
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,250
yeah,

390
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,050
I put some of those in the show
notes.

391
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,540
What do you think?

392
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,090
I don't know. It's just an it's
lame. Personally, I think is

393
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:12,420
lame

394
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,510
thought is funny. If the
question is, are those governors

395
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,210
who are on the trader trading
cards? Are they going to be

396
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,800
implicated in the database?

397
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,240
This hope so

398
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,460
that's hope something's in there
of some value. And this plays

399
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:32,130
plays right into President
Trump's I think overall plan,

400
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:37,110
have lots and lots of lawsuits.
let everybody see the the fraud

401
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:40,530
that took that took place. And I
think it's successfully moved it

402
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:46,590
from baseless to not widespread
to no evidence of widespread and

403
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:54,330
then of course, to the Supreme
Court. suit that was filed by

404
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,130
the state of Texas and joined by
I think 16 other states and the

405
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,600
president joined in. And well,
obviously cnn had something to

406
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,990
say about this, because even
before the Supreme Court did

407
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,560
look at it, we knew that it was
obviously racist.

408
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,780
So we reached out to Greg Locke,
the pastor,

409
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,440
from Canada. I'm sorry, that's
the wrong one. Damn it.

410
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,080
They came up with racist.

411
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,570
Oh, wait, it's very easy. It's
very simple. Here it is.

412
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:25,680
The President tries to undermine
democracy, and seems to identify

413
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,740
with insurrection. The President
has joined a lawsuit from the

414
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,230
Attorney General of Texas
himself under federal

415
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,890
investigation to try to overturn
the results of the election, he

416
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,160
lost the President's filing with
the Supreme Court states, quote,

417
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,360
our country is deeply divided in
ways that it arguably has not

418
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,400
been since the election of 1860.
So leave aside the circular

419
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,730
logic of decrying division when
he is the one stoking it, but

420
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,210
that reference to the election
of 1860. You know, why the

421
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,570
country was divided by that
election? Because Abraham

422
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:01,740
Lincoln one fairly in slave
states were pissed about that.

423
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,520
And they succeeded. And there
was a civil war. So by the

424
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,270
reasoning of the President's
crack legal team, Joe Biden is

425
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:13,620
Abraham Lincoln here. The guy
who won in the president is the

426
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,680
slave state, the ones who
succeeded and then the Civil

427
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,550
War. That's who Donald Trump is
relating to this morning, as

428
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,850
3000 new Coronavirus deaths were
reported overnight.

429
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,920
No, it's interesting. Love that
COVID kicker. Guys, it gets a

430
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,360
douchebag for that analysis.
There's a better analysis. Okay.

431
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,060
It's from the election of 1864
when the democrats try to rig

432
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,180
the election against Lincoln, so
I wouldn't get reelected and

433
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,650
just fell short.

434
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,410
Yeah. Okay.

435
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,360
That's more apt. Unfortunately.
I mean, after they, they tried

436
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,410
to rig the election against, I
would say George W. Bush too,

437
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:00,000
and they finally got one to work
with Nixon and Kennedy. They

438
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,680
rigged the election and jack
kennedy and

439
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,730
right well, so this is new. And
this is how long it's been going

440
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:10,350
on. And what's new is, oh,
there's gambling going on there.

441
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,740
Now everyone's eyes have been
awakened, because I think the

442
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:20,310
Trump platform has really
focused all of its efforts. I

443
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,580
know, I've been getting all the
incoming, focusing all of its

444
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,510
efforts on blanketing every
single alternative media show

445
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,580
that's out there, which arguably
is more mainstream than the

446
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,560
mainstream just in sheer
numbers. And the message is

447
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:45,270
China. The message is votes
stolen. Lots of corruption. Look

448
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,390
at all the evidence, there's
sufficient evidence. Some of it

449
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:53,220
might actually overturn states.
It's not getting its its play in

450
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,220
court. But I don't think that
matters at this point, based on

451
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,420
the strategy that I see. And of
course, there's a movement being

452
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:06,120
pushed. And it's being riled up
because just like 1864, the

453
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,480
President is going to need a lot
of people on his side, and

454
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,270
they're coming out in force. And
I think you have a couple clips

455
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,660
from it. So I didn't clip
anything. But I did get the

456
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,250
opening of the rally that took
place in Washington, DC

457
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:20,910
yesterday.

458
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,690
All right. You beautiful
patriots. Are you ready to

459
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,340
pierce the heart of darkness?

460
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,380
I thought that was apropos. Are
you ready to pierce the heart of

461
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,250
darkness?

462
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:39,539
Yeah. Does it feel good? It was
your feel good rally. And Mike.

463
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:43,589
I got one funny clip from that,
which is they had Mike lindahl

464
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,110
Oh, yeah, I heard about this. I
look for a clip you

465
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:50,370
found he found him that well,
yeah. It was actually a minute

466
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,310
48 of me. He went on for about
five or six minutes yakking

467
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,040
away. Yeah, but he was funny
because I didn't realize you

468
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,580
know, you get to see his
personality. And he was out.

469
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,150
They caught him out in the he
was in the audience and somebody

470
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:08,670
found hold him up, right. Yeah.
And the thing is that I got the

471
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,630
clip, but I apologize in advance
for the sound variation, because

472
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,260
it was very poorly miked. But
here's, here's Mike, they found

473
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,860
him out their

474
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,160
recent Supreme Court decision.

475
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,440
I got good news for everybody.
Sidney Powell, I got a text last

476
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,190
night. And they had nothing to
do with their when all they're

477
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,780
doing and they turned all of
their lawsuits to the Supreme

478
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,440
Court last

479
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,560
names and now all the fraud will
be revealed. She has all the

480
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,490
evidence, believe me, she's
still 100% in soy my that Donald

481
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,640
Trump will be our president for
four more years. We're all here

482
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,630
to pray today. That everything
that God opens doors, no man can

483
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:59,400
shot and that it's gonna be
amazing. We're here to get we're

484
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,490
praying that God gives us mercy
and gives us

485
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,900
the fortune what I believe is
where the greatest time where

486
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,050
everything's getting revealed.
And we're gonna be in the

487
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,360
biggest revival in history for
Jesus.

488
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,060
To see me have any idea about
the timeline, she expects from

489
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,750
the Supreme Court

490
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,130
Justice, just a text that she
said, Why are Kansai would be

491
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,120
able to tell the people that
keep the keep the whole, this is

492
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,320
such an anomaly in history that
nobody really knows timelines

493
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,300
and stuff like that. But I do
know this. I put myself I put

494
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,710
everything I had in the last
three weeks, financial and

495
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:45,540
everything I put that in,
because I know 100% our lecture

496
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,800
was stolen. Yeah, no, we can't
we we have to stand up as a

497
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,540
nation and we cannot. We cannot
allow this to happen. And all I

498
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,810
know is just just the fraud, the
machines, it's all gonna be

499
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,690
revealed work everybody in this
country. I don't care if you're

500
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,080
a Democrat or Republican.
Everyone is gonna know what they

501
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,040
tried to do.

502
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:09,869
Yeah, that that that I think
will happen. I know you do the

503
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:11,969
job. Well, I just want to give
you a little rundown of what I'm

504
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:16,559
seeing the GA machines, that
forensic evidence is going to be

505
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,429
allowed to be shown even though
it was initially locked down,

506
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:24,989
couldn't show it. And that
apparently will show some, some

507
00:29:24,989 --> 00:29:28,229
differences. There's there's
other interesting things coming

508
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:33,899
out about Biden's brother in
law. The firm that he works for

509
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:37,709
stable street capital, they are
part owner of Dominion systems.

510
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:43,139
Kamala Harris's husband, Doug,
he was a partner in Lord Mark

511
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:47,129
Malloch Brown's firm, which is
biggest law firm with

512
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:50,549
representation in China. I mean,
it's just, it's all it's all

513
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:55,229
being brought to a head, and I'm
just waiting for what I think

514
00:29:55,229 --> 00:30:00,959
will be the ultimate play which
at this point, I would have to

515
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:07,289
be pence stopping or delaying
the the count of the electoral

516
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:12,539
college votes. And from what I'm
understanding constitutionally,

517
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:15,959
once the Supreme Court said,
we're not, we're not a part of

518
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:19,679
this process, even though I
think arguably, they're supposed

519
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,679
to work on disputes between
states that they probably can

520
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,379
intervene with Pence, saying,
for instance, maybe says, Oh, I

521
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:37,409
want to have a, you know, simple
majority vote, whether the

522
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:39,659
alternate slate of electors
should be allowed, there's a lot

523
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:42,599
of leeway for him to do stuff.
And that's

524
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:45,150
what a lot of stuff they could
be done. I don't think anybody's

525
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:48,480
gonna be done. But that's just
my opinion. Now, the thing

526
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,880
that's interesting now is that
the media is getting all bent

527
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,330
out of shape, because the 12th
was the day that that the

528
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,720
Supreme Court ruled against Al
Gore. So now everything after

529
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,710
that it's new, his bad thing,
it's bad new history, but but

530
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,410
nobody wants to recognize the
fact that if you remember Al

531
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:09,960
Franken, when he was num elected
to the Senate in Minnesota, nine

532
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,600
months went by before that was
finalized

533
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,660
nine months if that was in the
presidential election

534
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,440
was beside the point it does
happen these jobs and could go

535
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,560
on, but on the 18th of December
is when when Trump Trump, I do

536
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,210
have to have a clip of this. You
mean

537
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,720
the executive order We've been
living under since 2018? That's

538
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,220
for decorative order. This

539
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,750
woman Lee Dunn, this is a lawyer
go. Yes. I saw you've seen this

540
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,710
skip. Yeah, it's good. Pete
talks about it. And on the 18th

541
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,080
is when the reports was to go
into the

542
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,190
well, it's no later no later
than the 18th. It was 45 days

543
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,050
after the election. So it could
come

544
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,590
at any time. You want to play
the lead done. disclose? Yes.

545
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,390
Yes. I think it's I think it's
very good. She

546
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,910
goes a little Wait, wait, wait,
what but before we do that,

547
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,340
since we're on the rally, I
don't want to jump away from

548
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:04,590
that. Because at the rally was
Alex Jones. Yeah, this rally was

549
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,050
a was a Christian rally.

550
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,630
It was the Jared Avenger. The
Jericho rally, I

551
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,720
think is what it was, yeah, the
Jericho route. And so I always

552
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,590
really was kind of disappointed
alex jones pandering to this

553
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:20,100
audience. You don't. If you're
talking to a Christian audience,

554
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,180
and you're not, you know, you
don't have to, you can talk to

555
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,810
them, like regular people. You
don't have to pander to them

556
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,560
just because they

557
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,150
know, he always does that. And
he uses my number one pet peeve

558
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,750
of Christian virtue signaling,
which Steve Bannon does, is by

559
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:41,100
saying, Well, today is the 13th
of December in the year of our

560
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,820
Lord 2020. That's the virtue
signaling.

561
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,810
pet peeve, I probably would have
caught it. I'm sure alex

562
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,160
jones doesn't all the time.

563
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:53,339
But I have two clips from judge
one of him pandering in this

564
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:57,569
second line, which I had to edit
way down. I was a funnier clip,

565
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,809
because he's got some lines in
there that are just just rich.

566
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:03,749
Well, let's play clip one.
Rockefeller,

567
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:08,729
not Bill Gates, not Barack
Obama, not Joe Biden, but Jesus

568
00:33:08,729 --> 00:33:16,649
Christ. And God gave us and rose
up Donald Trump to stand against

569
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:20,069
the enemy and draw out the
enemy. So as dark as some of

570
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:23,909
these days are, understand, this
is the beginning of the great

571
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:30,539
revival before the Antichrist
comes. World Government,

572
00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:36,119
implantable microchips, Satanism
is out of the open, the Bible is

573
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:40,259
fulfilled. Revelation is
fulfilled. Jesus Christ is

574
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:43,379
fulfilled. God Almighty, is in
charge.

575
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:48,510
Mighty God. Yeah,

576
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,270
wow, I've never heard him like
that. That's pretty.

577
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,170
I haven't either. I considered
it pandering and the whole thing

578
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:59,430
was like that. But I was
listening to him. And as he

579
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:06,720
could probably become a preacher
is not quite so good. I could

580
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,000
No, I know. But this guy, I'm
talking about the screaming can

581
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,080
where you blow out your lungs?

582
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,960
Well, just just one thing. And
one of our producers sent in a

583
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,810
note about the, you know, the
mark of the beast and all that.

584
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,730
And it also what what Jones
would just say, I think he's he

585
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:26,670
probably was talking about the
vaccine as well. And, and really

586
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:31,650
the 666 and then what is it the
the actual, this is all for the

587
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:35,580
end of times when you get the
the mark of the beast either on

588
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:40,560
your forehead or your right
hand. which is which is maybe

589
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,100
why Fauci is out there saying in
your arm, it's not in your hand,

590
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,440
not in your head. So your arm,
it's in your arm, that's where

591
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,940
it's gonna be good, don't worry
about it.

592
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,820
Let's listen to part two.

593
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,810
You look at the miserable
globalist. You look at people

594
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,520
like Bill Gates, and you look at
people like Mark Zuckerberg and

595
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,340
the rest of They are miserable
slaves of Satan. And we pray for

596
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,540
them, and hope that the Holy
Spirit can still touch their

597
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:15,630
soul. But more importantly, we
pray for President Donald john

598
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:22,440
Trump in this incredibly serious
moment. And we pray for all the

599
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,340
women in America with a system
trying to lie to to kill their

600
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:31,590
babies, and we say, don't kill
your babies. The enemy wants to

601
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:35,760
keep the whorehouses open and
the liquor stores open and the

602
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,720
Walmart's open and the targets
and the Amazons while they tell

603
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,470
you, the churches are not
essential. We will never get up.

604
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,370
We will never surrender. We will
never back down to the satanic

605
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:52,860
pedophile globalist New World
Order. And they're walking dead,

606
00:35:53,220 --> 00:36:00,690
reanimated corpse, Joe Biden.
And we will never recognize him.

607
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:06,450
Trump. President Trump had zero
connection to Russians. no proof

608
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,460
for years investigation. With
the Biden's it's open and shut.

609
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:15,540
So I don't know who's going to
the White House in 38 days. But

610
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:21,300
I should Oh, this Joe Biden is a
globalist and Joe Biden will be

611
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,070
removed one way or another.

612
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:29,460
You know, he's really been on a
tear lately. And I have a little

613
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,520
bit of insight into what's going
on. You know, he's been on

614
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,470
Rogan, he had Rogan on his show.
Then he went on Tim Poole on

615
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:41,340
Friday, which was pretty over
the top. He's even through

616
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,760
channels asked if I would
interview him and just use

617
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,010
snippets. I'm like, shit, man,
we didn't have you never

618
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,130
listened to the show. You don't
need for me to interview you. We

619
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,360
play plenty of snippets. But the
the deep platforming hurt him

620
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:01,410
very, very significantly. So the
only have to the only Avenue he

621
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,100
has is to go on other shows. And
then you know, Garner up

622
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,150
interest. It's his version of a
newsletter. He's got he's got to

623
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,240
get his he's got to get himself
out there. And yes,

624
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,800
I do. I will say I will say
something in regards to that. If

625
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,050
he had developed his audience
from the get go outside the

626
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:22,620
system,

627
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,510
he'd like certain people you
know of,

628
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,840
yeah, there are people that have
managed to do this. They've

629
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,890
decided it's a slow it's a slow
process of intelligence,

630
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:35,550
slow path to peace. But yes,
it's possible.

631
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,400
I think it would have been
better off.

632
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,420
Now. Did you get anything from
General Flynn? Oh, wait,

633
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,730
whenever we talk about General
Flynn, we have to we have to the

634
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,150
bugle.

635
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,550
General Flynn, he was

636
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,530
there. So I thought it was
boring.

637
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,680
He was very boring. That's why I
only brought the bugle because I

638
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,860
was like, Alright, what are you
gonna say? And he said pretty

639
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,890
much the same thing that he's
always said. And then the

640
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:08,970
President did a flyby in marine
one, which. And Flynn spent a

641
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:13,260
lot of time working on that.
What I heard from my channels

642
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:18,420
about Flynn, right after the
Texas lawsuit was not taken.

643
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:23,130
Rejected is not the right word,
but on procedural for procedural

644
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:27,210
reasons were not taken up. Was
it? mF is not worried about

645
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,810
anything. First, he's General
Flynn, why would you be

646
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:34,860
perfect.

647
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:41,250
I will say that the reason I the
most exciting thing in that in

648
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:46,110
that rally was Alex Jones. And I
will say that his his Brea

649
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,060
animated corpse line

650
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,860
is very good. I thought

651
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,090
it was the best line of the
show.

652
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:58,170
As I said, it's a big show
between now and but we have, we

653
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:02,040
have the 18th. And this this is
gonna have right now we have

654
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:07,350
military all around the country,
Ford you know, devil storm,

655
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,470
which obviously isn't exercise,
they do it every single year.

656
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:15,960
It's very nice how it coincides
with Operation warp speed, which

657
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:21,570
is kicking off today. And, and
Monday as we come to plunge the

658
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:27,600
needle into the arm of hundreds
of millions of Americans. Who

659
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:32,700
knows what could happen? There
could be under this, but I want

660
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,630
to play this clip now under this
executive order from 2018. We

661
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:41,310
are in fact, under the executive
order under a national emergency

662
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:44,730
which we've been under since 911
is all kinds of national

663
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,760
emergencies that every president
including this one, just let me

664
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,730
re up that one and get to do
cool stuff, get the fly the

665
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:54,630
drones don't want to get rid of
that one. And everything that

666
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:59,580
took place in the 2018 election
when right after this executive

667
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:04,320
order was written took place in
2020. And we'll see if we get

668
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,210
some kind of tribunal from the
military or what's going to

669
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:13,800
happen. Here's where she from
this lead done this is she from?

670
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:20,520
But I thought she was a DC
attorney, but I'm not sure. Yes,

671
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,250
I know. She's an attorney.
Anyway, here's here's her.

672
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,550
Here's her view of the the
executive order. Hey

673
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,070
folks, human rights attorney
Litem this year, I want to talk

674
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,250
to you

675
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,750
a little bit.

676
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:34,650
What's the Hey folks, come on.
Hey, guys, is what it is.

677
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:37,290
Alright, guys, come on, folks.

678
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:39,479
Human rights attorney Litem this
year, I want to talk to you

679
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:43,649
today, a little bit about a
recent declaration of a national

680
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,739
emergency by President Trump to
deal with the threat of

681
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:50,729
interference in US elections,
and how this intersects Trump's

682
00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:54,599
legal team statements in the
last 48 hours on the election

683
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,989
irregularities, if you will, and
what this all means taken as a

684
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:01,709
whole. So recently, Donald Trump
issued an executive order that I

685
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:05,099
was actually not familiar with,
entitled imposing certain

686
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,219
sanctions in the event of
foreign interference in the

687
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:12,209
United States election. In that
order, he noted that people have

688
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:16,919
the ability to interfere in or
undermine public confidence in

689
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:19,919
the United States elections.
These are direct quotes, this

690
00:41:19,919 --> 00:41:23,459
ability included and I quote,
again, the unauthorized

691
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:28,019
accessing of election and
campaign infrastructure, which

692
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:31,109
was defined to include
information and communications

693
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:35,399
technology, as well as systems
used by or on behalf of the

694
00:41:35,399 --> 00:41:38,909
federal government or a state or
local government in managing the

695
00:41:38,909 --> 00:41:42,119
election process, which
specifically if you look at the

696
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:44,729
definitions of what this all
sort of devolves down to

697
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:48,539
includes, and I quote, again,
voter registration databases,

698
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:52,619
voting machines, voting
tabulation, equipment, and

699
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,869
equipment for the secure
transmission of election

700
00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:58,139
results. Trump further noted
appointment come back to later

701
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:01,139
in this little piece, that
people have the ability to

702
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:05,099
interfere with elections
through, quote, distribution of

703
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:10,919
propaganda, and disinformation,
and quote, the President went on

704
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:13,289
and later paragraphs of the
executive order to state that

705
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:16,649
the, quote, proliferation of
digital devices and internet

706
00:42:16,649 --> 00:42:20,189
best based communications has
created significant

707
00:42:20,459 --> 00:42:24,029
vulnerabilities and magnified
the scope and intensity of the

708
00:42:24,029 --> 00:42:27,569
threat of foreign interference.
And then he opined that such

709
00:42:27,569 --> 00:42:33,389
constituted quote, and unusual
and extraordinary threat to the

710
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:37,559
national security of the United
States, after which he

711
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:42,179
unequivocally concluded, I
hereby declare a national

712
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:43,319
emergency.

713
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:47,640
Right. He's got a lot of leeway
under national emergency and it

714
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,500
all falls under the military
intelligence. So the Director of

715
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,720
National Intelligence will give
us a full load down sometime

716
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,800
this week. I don't think we have
to wait until the 18th.

717
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:05,280
It'll be on the 18th is my
prediction. Um,

718
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:11,430
whatever it is, the President is
definitely riling up magga

719
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:16,140
country to be at the ready to
fight for him. This is I think

720
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,900
this is much more serious than I
think certainly you think

721
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,670
because it tears are going to
come and we will see some

722
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:29,070
attempt at trials, tribunals
some attempted arresting people,

723
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,940
again, it'll all be tied back to
China to the illegal voting and

724
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,670
we'll all be done under this
executive order. And it's going

725
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,360
to get crazy. I can I can feel
it happening.

726
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,050
I know. Well, maybe

727
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,360
you can feel it in Texas. I sure
don't feel it here.

728
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,990
Well, no. What? Hello, did you
not see where we want to kick

729
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:52,320
you out of the country? We were
creating our own country over

730
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,400
here, son and we don't need you.
If you would take in the clue

731
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,490
and the cue from your fellow
Californians and moved here.

732
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:03,630
Holy crap. We just got Oracle.
We got Oracle. We got Hewlett

733
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:09,240
Packard. We got Tesla. Oh, my
goodness. What's left? You get

734
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:09,450
all the

735
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:12,390
crap a lot. All the Google for
one.

736
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,780
Yeah. Well, apples got a big
campus here. You've got all the

737
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,330
latest flying saucer that
landed? Oh, no.

738
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:21,930
Well, congratulate
Congratulations. You've got it

739
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,560
there. Well, I'm certainly
hoping that the President

740
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,130
prevails. Because if there's one
thing Well, there's a couple

741
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:31,830
things we've been called
throughout the past five years,

742
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,100
the worst of which is
Republicans, which I find very

743
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:39,900
insulting when someone calls us
Republicans. But the overall

744
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,080
it's very and so I've never
belonged the worst ever. Well,

745
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,410
I have been I will say I'm going
to repeat for the new listeners,

746
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,330
because there's always two or
three of them. I began my whole

747
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:54,510
life as a Democrat. I was raised
as a Democrat and I was raised

748
00:44:54,510 --> 00:45:00,300
in a Democrat. I was a Democrat.
Pretty much. My earliest career

749
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,430
as a working person, I became I
became a Republican. during the

750
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:09,390
Reagan administration, I did not
think Jimmy Carter was a good

751
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:12,690
president, I thought that I
decided the democrats were a

752
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,480
bunch of people that botched
everything, and then became

753
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,470
republican and it was republican
for, I don't know, 10 years or

754
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:23,880
longer or 1516. And then I
decided that the Republican

755
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,880
Party's a bunch of douchebags,
too. And so I became an

756
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,790
independent, and then I
registered as an independent and

757
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,280
stayed as such until I realized
that you can be something as

758
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,110
even beyond independent, non
affiliated Yes, that's what I am

759
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:37,980
today, is it?

760
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,770
Is it unaffiliated or non
affiliated?

761
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,330
I think it's unaffiliated, but
I'm also like, non affiliate, so

762
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:46,530
just a bit more dramatic.

763
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,130
I've never belong to any
political party. I don't I just

764
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:50,460
not

765
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:57,720
all of them share peace or
freedom. Now, I consider myself

766
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,960
a libertarian after I

767
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,280
think that's, yeah, I

768
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,360
think that's just that's that's
a cop out. I mean, I shield for

769
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,020
Ron Paul.

770
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,170
I don't I'm not registered as
such.

771
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,530
No, no, I'm just saying that I
shield for ron paul in 2008. I

772
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:15,810
didn't register as a
libertarian, but I thought he

773
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:18,060
had the right idea. I was just
learning about the Federal

774
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:22,740
Reserve from him. Like, oh, so I
was, I was late, late comer a

775
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,770
late bloomer. But now one of the
things so we're not

776
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:26,730
Republicans.

777
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:32,790
No, but we have also been called
apologists, Trump apologists.

778
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:38,940
And this has you and me, my
friend on the list on the target

779
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,790
list. We have been Trump
apologists

780
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:45,449
tell you something about the 69
million people that voted for

781
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:48,989
Donald Trump. These people have
revealed themselves for the

782
00:46:48,989 --> 00:46:53,639
racist that they are for the
tribalism that they are viewing.

783
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:57,779
That's every Trump voter. They
voted for this consciously

784
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,529
knowing what Donald Trump stood
for for the last four years.

785
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,650
You are being targeted, but not
because you're victims, because

786
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,410
you're victimizing the rest of
us. And I don't think that they

787
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,140
should be forgotten. And I don't
think that we should look the

788
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,230
other way. I think we need to
remember people must remember

789
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,440
and hold you to account. I do
think that people need to be

790
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,370
held accountable.

791
00:47:20,399 --> 00:47:22,469
How much are we gonna just

792
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:24,570
let past five you cannot come

793
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:27,510
into this White House with the
idea that these people aren't

794
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:28,890
the enemy. They are

795
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,160
the hottest places in hell,
reserved for those who are tired

796
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,380
of moral crisis. remain neutral,

797
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,850
Shame on them. They are going to
lose way more than this

798
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:39,660
election.

799
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:43,619
We want the prisons so filled
with Trump's and Trump flunkies

800
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:47,249
and Trump apologists and Trump
enablers that we have to convert

801
00:47:47,249 --> 00:47:51,599
Trump buildings into new god
damned Trump prisons. We want

802
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,269
enough of them in there that
they can hold reunions and

803
00:47:54,269 --> 00:47:55,559
birthday parties.

804
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,980
This is some ugly ass talk, man.

805
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,140
These people are sick.

806
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,790
That's pretty ugly.

807
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,700
That is some of the most sick.
This is they're talking about

808
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,100
fellow Americans and then
they're supposed to be the big

809
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,310
igniters Oh, we're gonna unite
everybody. And this is the

810
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:15,000
rhetoric that we hear. Mm hmm.
And then we Yeah, we can be

811
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,730
called apologist but I want
people to pay careful attention

812
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,050
to this type of talk.

813
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:26,460
And this is embedded in the
system. It was it was amazing. I

814
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:31,140
found amazing interview with
Rachel Maddow on Cole bear. And,

815
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:35,070
you know, she's, of course, you
know, she is the, the mack daddy

816
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:39,300
of of cable news. And everyone
fawns over her loves her so

817
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:44,580
much. But just listen to how she
explains what her job actually

818
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:48,090
is and how it changed with the
Trump administration. She's

819
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:52,050
admitting it now that it's
coming to an end. To some

820
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:52,590
degree.

821
00:48:53,009 --> 00:48:54,659
Do you have any perspective on
what it's done?

822
00:48:54,959 --> 00:48:57,239
Are you asking basically did
this break me?

823
00:48:57,899 --> 00:49:01,019
No. But it did it did it in some
way change your chemical

824
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:01,979
composition?

825
00:49:02,879 --> 00:49:08,609
It might have changed what I am
able to digest and how I mean, I

826
00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:14,459
feel like this was, I mean, this
is a great time to be in the

827
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:18,569
news business, because we've
never been more vital just to

828
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:21,749
learn these basic rules. Vital,

829
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:25,470
I am vital. I tell you, I've
never been more vital than

830
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:26,130
during this election,

831
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,100
and that if we didn't know them
before, you know, don't listen

832
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,770
to what they're saying. Just
watch what they're doing. You

833
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:35,880
know, don't don't don't take at
face value, something that you

834
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,800
got from a government official
just because a government

835
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,090
official is saying it.

836
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,670
How about all those people who
are familiar with the

837
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:44,670
President's thinking and sources
say Holy crap,

838
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:48,360
those rules became very easy to
remember all of a sudden again

839
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,940
in the Trump administration,
which is good, but they're good

840
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,330
rules for us for all time. I
just feel like to a certain

841
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:58,980
extent, like training to do this
work means you like learn the

842
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,060
rules of the road. And you learn
how to operate safely and you

843
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,050
like build up your skills, you
know, you take lessons you learn

844
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:09,150
from the best you do. It's like,
like getting a commercial

845
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:11,790
driver's license, like, I'm
going to be a big rig driver,

846
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:14,010
I'm going to be out on America's
highways, I'm going to convey

847
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:17,100
myself down that Highway in a
way that is safe for my fellow

848
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:20,460
travelers. And then you enter
into this administration, and

849
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,710
instead of getting your big
Reagan getting on the highway,

850
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:25,410
it turns out his bumper cars and
all the cars, what you're gonna

851
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:28,650
do all day is smash into each
other and try to hurt each

852
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,200
other. And that's your driving.
That's your job. Now,

853
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,910
I see that my job is to get in
the bumper car and go and drive

854
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,350
into people and hurt them.

855
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,050
This is the thinking.

856
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,520
It's a fast fitting analogy.

857
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:47,969
Yeah. But that's that's the
thinking here. It's like, oh, it

858
00:50:47,969 --> 00:50:51,059
wasn't the way it wasn't the way
it's supposed to be. So I might

859
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:52,769
as well just go do the same
thing.

860
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:55,140
It's a lot more fun. psychos.

861
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,470
Anyway, According to NBC, Trump
is all but admitted defeat.

862
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,220
Tonight, a rare acknowledgement
from President Trump that he'll

863
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,040
soon be out of the White House
tweeting the Biden

864
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,520
administration will be a scandal
plagued mess for years to come.

865
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,880
A reference to the federal
criminal investigation of hunter

866
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,300
Biden's finances. Authorities
examining whether the younger

867
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,020
Biden violated tax and money
laundering laws in his Chinese

868
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,290
business dealings. Hunter Biden
says everything was handled

869
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,100
legally and appropriately.
President Trump has often taken

870
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,490
aim at Hunter Biden, but now a
new target his own attorney

871
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:33,060
general tweeting, why didn't the
DOJ report the Biden matter

872
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:36,420
before the election, all of it
as president elect Biden

873
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,120
announced a number of former
Obama officials for his

874
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,410
administration. They know how
government should and can work

875
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:47,310
for all Americans, including
former Obama National Security

876
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:51,300
Adviser Susan Rice to lead his
Domestic Policy Council, former

877
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:54,270
chief of staff for Veterans
Affairs.

878
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:02,040
I was gonna put a pool together
nooses and rice was somehow

879
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,200
gonna get into this
administration. It was

880
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,460
not formal yet but it seems like
she's in looks like she did it

881
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:08,640
who

882
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,200
did the hell wants her in this
administration? She's a creep.

883
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:13,710
Well, I

884
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:19,800
think if I were to guess Black
Lives Matter is mad. They're mad

885
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,830
because the administration is
not taking their phone call so I

886
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:24,990
think maybe it's like got him a
blacks

887
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,280
are really part of Black Lives
Matter. Doesn't

888
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,650
matter. What color did you vote
for me?

889
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:32,189
You're black.

890
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,440
All right in in what else could

891
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,080
it be to lead his Domestic
Policy Council

892
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,420
Domestic Policy Council on us
and

893
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,730
what is what is that exactly?

894
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:43,710
It's just a way to get the black
lady in.

895
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,320
What she gets your foot in the
door she's Ambassador next

896
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,340
thing, you know, Domestic

897
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:53,370
Policy Council. Let's see what
it is. Let's see what it is.

898
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:57,690
including former Obama National
Security Adviser Susan Rice to

899
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:00,870
lead his Domestic Policy
Council, former Obama Chief of

900
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:03,990
Staff Denis McDonough for
Veterans Affairs and former

901
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:08,100
Obama Agriculture Secretary Tom
Vilsack to lead that department

902
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:13,560
again. A big moment for Biden on
Monday when 538 electors will

903
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,340
cast their votes in all the
states to certify his victory in

904
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:21,990
the Domestic Policy Council. The
United States is the principal

905
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,060
form used by the President of
the United States for

906
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:28,560
considering domestic policy. All
right. Let's see who's on it.

907
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:33,060
Right now. pence bar a czar Chad
wolf.

908
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:35,100
Okay, so it's it's based
drinking,

909
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:40,470
basically the whole cabinet.
Additional participants Wheeler

910
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:46,830
from EPA Mulvaney Larry Kudlow,
okay, it's it's it's like a

911
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:50,100
drink like a Friday at Club five
to Friday afternoon club. We

912
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,000
have a little drink.

913
00:53:51,569 --> 00:53:54,539
Yeah, Friday afternoon drink.
Yes, once a week. I just get

914
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:56,849
together what are we going to
call it well, what can we do?

915
00:53:56,969 --> 00:54:00,479
What can what can we convene
that so we can write off our

916
00:54:00,479 --> 00:54:05,249
drinks? Oh, my God. Oh, we had
the Domestic Policy Council.

917
00:54:05,249 --> 00:54:07,019
Let's have a meeting. Ah, yeah.

918
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:12,780
Meeting meeting bringing the
drinks. If people are you know,

919
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:18,360
it's been we've been talking
about this so long about about

920
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:23,670
China and the infiltration into
the into pretty much all of our

921
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:26,790
big areas, all the ones that the
President has been made to look

922
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:27,960
like a dunce.

923
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:33,270
Of course, the media is top top
of the list, but I love

924
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,140
the someone sent me a couple of
sound clips from a game from a

925
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,350
video game. This is not even a
new game. It's the Command and

926
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:43,830
Conquer. I think this one was
the generals and it's the US

927
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:47,940
fighting against China. And just
listen to I don't know who

928
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,430
programmed this thing. Listen to
some of these quotes.

929
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,140
China has been generous.

930
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,170
Then there's this building the
Chinese Empire. Yeah. And then

931
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:02,070
we have big plans. I like that
one a lot. That sounds good.

932
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,600
I know we'll grow larger.

933
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,300
Mm hmm. And then there's this
one without

934
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,760
the protesters Get out of my
way. I'm

935
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,300
busy.

936
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:10,440
Don't trust

937
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:14,370
my way.

938
00:55:18,779 --> 00:55:20,099
Isn't that the best one?

939
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,500
The best one. You just play that
routinely.

940
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:26,910
It's so good

941
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,730
day protesters Get out of my
way. I'm

942
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:30,300
busy.

943
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:37,800
I'm busy. That's how they think
about you. Ah, all right. So

944
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:42,060
we'll see. But I love that
Thursday will be our show day. I

945
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,600
hope nothing happens on show day
itself. There's so many cool

946
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:51,300
things happening this month. On
the 21st we have a rare

947
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:56,550
Christmas star occurrence, which
happens only once every it

948
00:55:56,550 --> 00:56:00,570
happened 1000 years ago where
Jupiter and Venus can join in

949
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:04,620
the sky visible from Earth.
Yeah. And it will look like a

950
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:08,070
very bright star, which some say
might have been how the Star of

951
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:14,280
Bethlehem came came into play.
Yeah. And then on the 21st of

952
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,560
January, just some other crazy

953
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,800
astrologers going nuts. It's
nuts.

954
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:27,240
Excuse me. So all of this stuff
should obviously behoove Donald

955
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,480
Trump since it can't be the star
of Bethlehem. If he's not going

956
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,330
to defeat evil. Hello. so
obvious. so obvious. Yeah,

957
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:37,410
that's it?

958
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:44,550
Yes. Well, you know, I I do not
underestimate the American

959
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:50,070
public. And I think that there's
a significant portion that have

960
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:52,890
been riled up and I'm not going
to take it. And they're going

961
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,800
they want to see some fireworks
from this president, regardless

962
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,670
of the outcome. They want to see
some fireworks. And I think to

963
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:02,610
be fair about it, so do I. I
mean, we've been waiting for the

964
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:06,750
1000s of totally sealed
indictments for five years.

965
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:11,280
That's now when the over 200,000
give us one or two before you

966
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,590
go. If you go

967
00:57:14,549 --> 00:57:17,459
one, anything but you're gonna
get nothing.

968
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:23,910
Okay? I it ain't over till it's
over. So he on the 21st on the

969
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:27,690
twin argue that pretty hard to
top. It ain't over till it's

970
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:30,540
over until the fat lady sings.
But

971
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:36,480
we shall see. Okay. And this is
really nothing left to report

972
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:40,470
other than hopefully today,
we'll have some of the names on

973
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:43,050
the Chinese Database List. I
think that's that's,

974
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,479
I just want those names. Who did
well, I have

975
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,260
the whole database. I got the
dump. It's too delicious to

976
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:54,120
believe. Oh, we need to talk
about the COVID for a moment I

977
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:58,980
watched the brand new movie came
out on December 11th overhyped

978
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:05,370
the Michael Bay produced
songbird about the COVID 23

979
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:09,780
locked down. I figured there
might be some messages in there

980
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:15,150
something that would give us a
clean a thing. Yes, I did. The

981
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:19,740
movie is a humongous piece of
crap. It is really

982
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:24,570
disappointing. I mean, yeah, it
looks great, because everyone is

983
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:28,740
locked down except people who
are immune, which is a small

984
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:33,900
group and the immunes get an A
yellow immune armband, which you

985
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:38,190
need is scanned by the
authorities. And the movie is

986
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:41,340
pretty much about a bike
messenger guy who's immune who's

987
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:48,030
fallen in love via video text
with a with a young woman. And

988
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:51,000
it's about their romance and how
he then tries to get her a

989
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,220
yellow badge to get her to live
free. And that's it is it and

990
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:59,520
there's no social message other
than you're going to be shipped

991
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,820
off to the cue zone. I kind of
like that. The quarantine zone

992
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:08,040
they called the cue zone. And,
and everything else looks like

993
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,830
it is now except just crap here.

994
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:12,240
So is boring. It's

995
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,720
very boring. It was especially
like, watch,

996
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,960
you actually managed to watch
the whole thing. And it was that

997
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:22,710
it was dull. I watched the whole
10 minutes I'm done with these

998
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:23,130
movies.

999
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,740
I watched the whole thing as a
public service. So no one else

1000
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:29,460
has to spend their money on it,
please. I did I do that. I do

1001
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:29,730
that. I

1002
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:33,510
admire that. Yes. You can still
watch 10 minutes and tell people

1003
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:34,290
not to watch it.

1004
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:36,510
No, but I like going for the
full thing.

1005
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:39,720
And

1006
00:59:40,259 --> 00:59:41,969
like to get people to whole
load.

1007
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:45,300
I do like people to give the
whole load. All right, let's

1008
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:48,180
talk about some bullcrap with
the COVID because it's really

1009
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,800
getting laid on thick
everywhere.

1010
00:59:50,339 --> 00:59:53,789
All right, well, I have a series
of clips on the rollout dissolve

1011
00:59:53,789 --> 00:59:54,869
yesterday's clips.

1012
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:59,160
Oh, wait, roll. Before we do the
vaccine, let's just do a couple

1013
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,160
more situation. Awareness
because I want it the vaccine is

1014
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,650
our Savior. So we need to save
that for the last.

1015
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:11,009
Yeah, okay, you can do the thing
and now we're off the vaccine

1016
01:00:11,009 --> 01:00:14,519
but I should at least give you a
good idea where this is coming

1017
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:19,979
from by doing this Saturday
rundown on NBC. Yes. And see we

1018
01:00:19,979 --> 01:00:23,489
she just wants you to play this
rundown to listen to the

1019
01:00:23,489 --> 01:00:28,079
difference in tone. It was
always Oh, we're all gonna die.

1020
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:30,869
We're all gonna die and Trump's
an idiot and he's he won't leave

1021
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:31,289
office.

1022
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,650
Oh, drinking bleach. Yes. Okay,
UV lights. Yes. All right, DME.

1023
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:38,400
Yes.

1024
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,630
Sorry. Now the rundowns a lot
different.

1025
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:46,200
Breaking News Tonight, the
moment we have been waiting for

1026
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,370
the FDA authorizes emergency use
of a COVID vaccine, calling it

1027
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:55,890
safe and effective. D day was
the beginning of the end.

1028
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,690
And that's where we are today.

1029
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:01,830
But now the unprecedented
national effort to produce and

1030
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:05,370
administer the vaccine, as the
death toll hits a new one day

1031
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:09,510
record. The first vaccination is
now set for Monday. We're on the

1032
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:12,660
ground with UPS and FedEx as
they begin this massive

1033
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:16,470
challenge delivering the most
important packages in history.

1034
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:21,420
This is a monumental event. It
may be our finest hour.

1035
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:25,290
Hospitals first in line to get
the vaccine, how doctors and

1036
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:28,710
nurses are getting ready amid a
brutal surge in communications.

1037
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:34,050
One state has just run out of
ICU beds. Supreme rejection,

1038
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,700
the latest attempt to overturn
the

1039
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:39,180
second that was great Did I hear
like a crash cart going when you

1040
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:42,510
said running out like a like
someone coding in the

1041
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:46,500
background. One state has just
run out of ICU beds.

1042
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:54,630
Well done boys patients.

1043
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:59,970
One state has just run out of
ICU beds. Supreme rejection,

1044
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:03,120
the latest attempt to overturn
the election shot down by the

1045
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,500
Supreme Court mid year report
card. We've been following these

1046
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,740
high school students since the
first day of class their raw

1047
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:12,750
emotions in this challenging
year.

1048
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,370
With Jose Diaz balart Yeah, so

1049
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:26,070
Texas is still open. Although
Mayor Adler has now announced I

1050
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:31,140
think from his timeshare in
Cabo, that we could be going

1051
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:34,740
into stage five we've never been
in stage five but now apparently

1052
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:37,710
we're going there and that would
of course mean we have to shut

1053
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:41,610
everything down which I don't
think it's going to happen he

1054
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:46,950
has no leg to stand on. We went
out last night to to Verna,

1055
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:50,310
which is an Italian restaurant
downtown which closed for

1056
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:53,430
several months during the Rona
and they did a complete

1057
01:02:53,430 --> 01:03:00,540
renovation. And it's now kind of
turned in from like a just a

1058
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:03,660
regular old Italian restaurant
kind of looks like an Italian

1059
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:07,680
restaurant woody on the inside.
It's turned into a you know

1060
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:14,820
white marble top, a hipster
hangout with the with the club

1061
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:18,420
music going I mean throw some
sand on the floor and then hang

1062
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,120
up a mirror ball and you've got
a santro pay club. It was

1063
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:25,410
fantastic. But social
distancing, no. Was shoulder to

1064
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:31,050
shoulder packed in this place.
No one gives a crap. The waiters

1065
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:34,350
and waitresses walking around
with with mass hanging off their

1066
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:39,450
chin not on the you know, under
their nose. No one cares. But

1067
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,360
the news tells you something
different. The news is telling

1068
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:48,150
you we need refrigerated trucks
for the dead. More eggs are

1069
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:52,650
fall. We need refrigerated
trucks because the marks are

1070
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:58,770
over silver filled with dead pus
filled bodies. And this report

1071
01:03:58,860 --> 01:03:59,100
is

1072
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:02,910
this is second time and you did
that last show too.

1073
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,130
Because that's how they make it
sound.

1074
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,530
And no, I'm talking about pus
filled

1075
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:09,150
Well that's because I know you
don't like it

1076
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:12,390
with the end of this colony on
it because I

1077
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:16,410
yeah, that's sorry I got another
one later.

1078
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:19,500
Oh, by the way I got we got just
I don't want to interrupt your

1079
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,640
train of thought. But the
apparently thing has a sister

1080
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,610
term. You know he's saying
apparently too seemingly.

1081
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,400
Seriously? Oh,

1082
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:33,390
I don't like I would rather have
apparently than seriously Did I

1083
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:34,200
say cereal?

1084
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,740
My daughter pointed this out.
She said you guys are saying

1085
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:41,490
seriously, you in particular
pointing at me. And so she

1086
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:44,130
catches that she kisses me
around the house. If I'm upset

1087
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,500
in the house, she'll call me out
which I think is great. I always

1088
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,490
think that's what you want.

1089
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,060
Yeah, that's

1090
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,490
what you want. What people don't
realize that that's what you

1091
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:55,920
want. But I I just keep an eye
out if I say seriously, please,

1092
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:57,300
please. Okay.

1093
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:58,980
Same same with me.

1094
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:02,130
All right.

1095
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:06,510
So in this clip which is about
Terran county in Texas, it

1096
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:11,370
starts off the same way. But
then they they give away the

1097
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:15,060
clue as to what is happening
here. It doesn't really have to

1098
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:19,440
do with your morgues being
overfilled with dead bodies from

1099
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,380
the infectious plague. Quite

1100
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:25,050
Hello and Good evening. I'm
Steve vigor it's nine o'clock

1101
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,950
Tarrant County is preparing for
an increase in COVID-19 deaths

1102
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:32,520
are now overflow registered
refrigeration units outside its

1103
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:36,360
morgue. Fox fours David from
kendry has more details from the

1104
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,740
county judge tonight David.

1105
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:41,910
a steep turn County Judge Glen
Whitley says conversations about

1106
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:45,660
bringing in refrigerated trucks
outside the medical examiner's

1107
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:48,330
office have been going on for
months. He says it's been a long

1108
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:52,260
time since this has happened but
that it points to these times

1109
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:56,400
that we are living in Tarrant
County reported 15 deaths today

1110
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,360
it reported 13 deaths yesterday
that 15 death count today is the

1111
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,570
highest number we have seen
since August when you take a

1112
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:06,390
look at the footage we have
you're going to see these wooden

1113
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:10,050
walls that are placed up at the
Medical Examiner's Office. These

1114
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:13,890
are what is surrounding those
trucks. The body count at the

1115
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:16,950
Emmys office is not only related
to COVID-19 but judge Whitley

1116
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:21,030
says it does make up a part of
it. He also says some families

1117
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:23,910
are slowing down the process of
having a body transferred from

1118
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:26,970
the Emmys office to a funeral
home because they're waiting to

1119
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:30,150
make funeral arrangements in
hopes that pandemic conditions

1120
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:31,290
will become safer.

1121
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,730
Hello. And that's the same
everywhere you hear this story.

1122
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:41,790
The funeral homes are not really
in business people want to have

1123
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:45,480
bigger ceremonies Hey, keep him
on ice for a while we want to

1124
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,770
have everyone hang out. Oh we're
locked down can't go. But now

1125
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:54,150
let's let's make it sound like
we're all going to die. Because

1126
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:56,370
oh man oh so horrible.

1127
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:02,610
Here is an interesting story. By
the way, it's what's really

1128
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:05,130
happening is so it was like the

1129
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:07,590
story we played on the last show
that woman that runs the

1130
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:10,320
hospitals. There's no COVID
people in here right

1131
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:18,330
now this is a pastor Greg Locke
from Tennessee, who is talking

1132
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:22,740
to was a CNN report and he
thinks this this is just a bunch

1133
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:23,250
of crap.

1134
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,550
So we reached out to Greg lock,
a pastor and conservative Wilson

1135
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:29,580
County Tennessee who says he has
grown his congregation by

1136
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,620
protesting COVID control
measures.

1137
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,330
We're not gonna close our church
ladies.

1138
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:37,620
There's a lot of sincere people
that are doing their best to put

1139
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,870
out a vaccine but that doesn't
mean I'm gonna take it. I don't

1140
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:42,360
believe the government can tell
me you know when or how I can

1141
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:45,270
stick a needle in my arm or my
kids arms super government

1142
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:48,360
overreach. Knox's he's moved his
services outdoors,

1143
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:51,540
not to limit the spread of
COVID. But to handle all the new

1144
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:51,930
people

1145
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:52,500
who've come

1146
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:54,210
to fear.

1147
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,700
I'm saying the sickness is real.
I'm saying the pandemic is not.

1148
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:03,300
I don't understand what you mean
when I say pandemics not real.

1149
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,560
pandemic is not real.

1150
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:09,060
But what do you think a pandemic

1151
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:09,810
is? Not?

1152
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:11,970
Not COVID-19.

1153
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,290
But what it is,

1154
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:15,060
is,

1155
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:17,250
I think we're stuck on this.

1156
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:22,680
There's no pandemic COVID

1157
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,220
what is the pandemic then?

1158
01:08:26,219 --> 01:08:27,539
Not what we're experiencing?

1159
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:30,450
I'm 44 years old. We've not had
one of my lifetime. So I don't

1160
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:31,830
know. And this is Nadia.

1161
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,800
I love the millennial kid.

1162
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:41,429
Well, you know, this is an old
news trick that was been

1163
01:08:41,429 --> 01:08:46,829
discussed in the past. You find
somebody with a with a kind of a

1164
01:08:47,069 --> 01:08:51,389
thick real country accent and
make them decide you want to

1165
01:08:51,389 --> 01:08:55,289
vilify? Yeah, and then you talk
to No, I'm not gonna hear

1166
01:08:55,289 --> 01:09:00,449
martial kick. Nobody's putting a
needle in my arm. Well, don't

1167
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:02,490
you know how safe vaccines are?

1168
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:08,670
Nobody's gonna put a needle and
mom I'm not new. But I mean that

1169
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:12,210
dude, you get a guy like it this
is just part of the propaganda

1170
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:14,850
mechanism is and it's really
shameful. It's

1171
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,100
a redneck red herring. It's
horrible. What they do with

1172
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:17,460
these people.

1173
01:09:17,489 --> 01:09:20,699
redneck red herring is it shows?
Yeah,

1174
01:09:20,969 --> 01:09:25,259
thank you trolls. Meanwhile,
over on MSNBC, there's the guy

1175
01:09:25,259 --> 01:09:28,559
who kicked it all off. I think
he was highly responsible.

1176
01:09:28,559 --> 01:09:32,939
Michael osterholm. He was the
guy that was on Joe Rogan show

1177
01:09:32,939 --> 01:09:36,869
in March when I was out there.
And he was telling Joe millions

1178
01:09:36,869 --> 01:09:41,309
are going to die. Well, he he
earned his stripes. boy. He's

1179
01:09:41,309 --> 01:09:45,269
everywhere. Now he gets to show
up and he's on the the the

1180
01:09:45,299 --> 01:09:51,239
president elect offices Advisory
Committee for the COVID and he's

1181
01:09:51,239 --> 01:09:53,489
got a message and it ain't
pretty. But you know, I've been

1182
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:57,419
very critical of the advice for
giving people for Christmas

1183
01:09:57,419 --> 01:10:01,199
holidays. You know, if we expect
That we're going to get out of

1184
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,839
this without having a big
increase in cases and

1185
01:10:03,839 --> 01:10:06,929
acknowledge that we're going to
have all kinds of new friends,

1186
01:10:07,139 --> 01:10:11,159
family members who have not been
bubbled up quarantine for 10

1187
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:13,079
days to our house for Christmas.

1188
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:15,600
What we're going to do is I will
guarantee you that

1189
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:19,980
grandpa or grandma won't be here
for Christmas. Oh, we have to

1190
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:24,240
get that kind of messy chairs.
This is our COVID year. This is

1191
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:27,720
our COVID Christmas, not like
last year, and I really believe

1192
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:30,780
with vaccines won't be like that
next year. But this year, if you

1193
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:34,980
love your family, if you really
care about your family, we won't

1194
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,650
have these get togethers, which
I know will be difficult,

1195
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,860
they'll be very difficult. But
we've got to start telling the

1196
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:44,280
public Exactly. You know, you
can't sugarcoat it anymore.

1197
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,810
It's all about human life.

1198
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,870
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1199
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:52,140
You know what? You know what
this guy? This guy reminds me of

1200
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:58,740
this reminds me of 1999. And the
same kind of guys that were all

1201
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:04,410
panicky about y2k. Ah, yes, he
sounds just like one of them.

1202
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:10,050
Oh, my God, you know, we got to
do this or that we're all going

1203
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:14,280
to go all of my, there's gonna
be no money. On January 1,

1204
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:18,210
it's right fill up your bathtub.
There'll be no water. I remember

1205
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:21,900
it. Right. I had my cash in the
freezer. I had my water in the

1206
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:25,710
tub. I was a believer, I was all
in, bring it to me bring it to

1207
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:30,060
me. The downside of doing the
best,

1208
01:11:30,089 --> 01:11:33,089
by the way, it's interesting
that they it's almost a 20 year

1209
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:38,249
cycle on that y2k to this and
there was a huge stock market

1210
01:11:38,249 --> 01:11:42,809
collapse, around margin mean
rolling next year, you just say

1211
01:11:42,809 --> 01:11:44,189
and write that down.

1212
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:48,480
The downside of being from the
future and doing the best

1213
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,900
podcast in the universe is that
many of the things that people

1214
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:57,720
see now, we have talked about or
played clips from or discussed

1215
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:01,830
months and months ago, to see
China. It's not like we haven't

1216
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:08,940
been all over that. But with
PCR, very early on analysis,

1217
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:13,050
understanding the cycle count,
this is now still relatively new

1218
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:16,650
for a lot of people, but also
played several clips from the

1219
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:22,200
inventor of the PCR the
polymerase chain reaction

1220
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:26,430
process, which is now
fraudulently been turned, I

1221
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:30,420
said, we'll say fraudulently
turned into a test. Certainly

1222
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:33,450
when it comes to accuracy, or
what it's really doing, or being

1223
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:38,370
able to use it as a test at all.
Kary mullis. So a lot of people

1224
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:40,980
are sending me the same things
we've done months and months

1225
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:44,970
ago. I mean, I even came across
an email the other day, I can't

1226
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:48,630
believe you haven't said
anything about event 201 you

1227
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:53,520
know, so we so add, please,
before you email us that go to

1228
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,980
Bing, it.io bi n gi t.io. And
just type in your term that you

1229
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:02,010
can't believe and it's a very
good search engine, it did

1230
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:05,430
parses all the show notes, all
the clips, so you can always

1231
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:09,300
find what we've been talking
about, or at least was on the

1232
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:14,010
docket. So Kary mullis, the
inventor of the PCR passed away

1233
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:19,470
late in 2019. Sadly, he would
have been a nice voice to have

1234
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:26,400
here, certainly around these PCR
bits test. And there was one

1235
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:32,250
interview that he did. And this
was an AIDS HIV AIDS activist

1236
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:37,020
interview because the PCR was
used to diagnose people with

1237
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:40,110
HIV, and it was the exact same
people who are going to get the

1238
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:44,520
Magical Vaccine, and who spent
hundreds of millions, if not

1239
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:49,440
billions of dollars, coming up
with pretty much nothing. And he

1240
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:53,370
talked about these guys in
particular Fauci so I wanted to

1241
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,970
replay that everyone can hear
what the inventor of PCR said

1242
01:13:57,150 --> 01:14:00,030
about the credibility of Anthony
Fauci,

1243
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:04,860
what is it? What What is it
about humanity that wants to go

1244
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:07,050
to the all the details and stuff
and listening, you know, these

1245
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:09,450
guys like bounty, get up there
and start talking to you know,

1246
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:12,180
he doesn't know anything really
about anything. And I'd say that

1247
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:16,470
to his face. Nothing. The man
thinks you can take a blood

1248
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:18,690
sample and stick it in an
electron microscope, and if it's

1249
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:21,990
got a virus in there, you will
know it. He doesn't understand

1250
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:25,140
electron microscopy, and he
doesn't understand medicine in

1251
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:28,620
that he should not be in a
position like us in. Most of

1252
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:31,740
those guys up there on the top
are just total administrative

1253
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:34,170
people, and they don't know
anything about what's going on

1254
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:38,640
the bottom. You know, those guys
have got an agenda, which is not

1255
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:42,120
what we would like them to have
being that we pay for them to

1256
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,690
take care of our health in some
way. They've got a personal kind

1257
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:49,470
of agenda. They make up their
own rules as they go they change

1258
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:52,260
them when they want to. And they
smugly like Tony Fauci does not

1259
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,450
mind going on television in
front of the people to pay a

1260
01:14:54,450 --> 01:14:58,980
salary and lie directly into the
camera. You can't expect the

1261
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:02,700
sheep To really respect the best
and the brightest, they don't

1262
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:07,260
know the difference. Really? I
mean, I like humans. Oh, don't

1263
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:11,910
get me wrong. But basically,
there is a there is a vast the

1264
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:18,480
vast majority of them do not
possess the ability to judge who

1265
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,480
isn't who isn't a really good
scientist. I mean, that's the

1266
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,520
problem. That's the main
problem, actually, with science,

1267
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,810
I'd say in this century, because
science is being judged by

1268
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:31,230
people. The funding is being
done by people who don't

1269
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:34,200
understand it. Okay, who we
trust bouchy thought you didn't

1270
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:37,230
know enough to know if Fauci
wants to get on television with

1271
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:39,990
somebody who knows a little bit
about this stuff and debate him,

1272
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:43,200
he could easily do it because
he's been asked, and there you

1273
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:43,890
go, kind of

1274
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:48,210
a damning review of Fauci as a
medical doctor sounds more like

1275
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:53,580
a bag man for the pharmaceutical
industry. And it's too bad Kary

1276
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:56,400
mullis is not with us today, I
would have loved to have asked

1277
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:00,900
him what he thought of Bill Nye
the Science Guy, who clearly who

1278
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,750
clearly wants to tell the
children of America what to do.

1279
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:04,560
Greetings, Bill

1280
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,600
Nye here with more on masks.

1281
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:08,310
Here's a map of the United
States, the

1282
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:13,050
reading shows where people are
wearing masks, and whacking

1283
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:17,730
shows where people are getting
sick with Corona, I hope you can

1284
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:20,970
see the fewer the mask the more
of those six. And there's a

1285
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:24,660
perception that a virus can
travel through the fibers of a

1286
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:27,810
mask like this red dot, because
viruses don't travel by

1287
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:29,190
themselves. They travel on

1288
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:31,050
droplets of spit,

1289
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:35,880
and snacks not in the fibers are
tangible. So when the droplet

1290
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:40,110
gets into the fibers of a mask,
it gets trapped. This is not

1291
01:16:40,110 --> 01:16:42,720
that hard to understand
everybody. That's why we have

1292
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:47,130
rules about wearing a mask. Now
you know about rules, you pay

1293
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:50,610
taxes on the whole road, but you
only get to drive on one

1294
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:52,290
side at a time otherwise.

1295
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:56,760
So everyone, please wear a mask.

1296
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:00,420
And there's my end of show ISO
candidate drunk.

1297
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:02,880
And not

1298
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:07,290
I just I couldn't not bring that
to the table.

1299
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,650
I know. You didn't say plus.

1300
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:19,560
Now he didn't say that. Now, um,
Fauci is not as dumb. I don't

1301
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:25,980
think as Kary mullis said in
that interview, I think Fauci is

1302
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:29,910
very, very smart. He knows
exactly what he's doing. And I

1303
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:34,470
have some examples of that. I'm
going to play a little slip he

1304
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:37,650
made and then I would like to
get into the vaccine delivery

1305
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:41,160
clips you have and then we'll
rip it all apart. So here is

1306
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:44,790
Fauci. And where it was, he was
in Vermont, for some reason

1307
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:47,400
doing a press conference about
the vaccine, and he of course,

1308
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,210
trusts it. So

1309
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:53,310
I would think that we trust the
FDA, they have pledged that they

1310
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:57,150
will do what the science tells
them to do. So I can tell you

1311
01:17:57,150 --> 01:18:01,530
based on my experience, and what
I'm seeing, if there's a

1312
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:05,220
vaccine, which I'm fairly
certain there will be that safe

1313
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:06,210
and effective.

1314
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:11,970
I for one, would not hesitate to
take it, nor would I recommend

1315
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:13,980
nor would I hesitate

1316
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,130
to recommend that my entire
family do

1317
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:18,720
it so I feel good about it.

1318
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:23,820
Truth wants to come out anybody?
I don't know. I would not I

1319
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:26,880
would. I would not recommend
that to my family. That's the

1320
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,300
best.

1321
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:33,900
I trust the FDA. A just take one
word thalidomide. Yeah, doubt up

1322
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:34,260
people.

1323
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:38,430
Yeah. Well, the thing that that
most of the anti vaxxers I will

1324
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:43,440
say, and I know many, what many
of them say is the problem with

1325
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:47,190
Coronavirus vaccines, which they
have tried in the past. It has

1326
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:52,470
always ended in disaster when
the inoculated and they've done

1327
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:57,720
this with the animals. When the
inoculated then get the virus

1328
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,890
again from the wild. They get
much sicker than they would have

1329
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:04,860
been without the vaccine and the
and the animal trials were

1330
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:08,220
skipped in this particular
process. And they killed all the

1331
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:10,470
mink I don't know if it's
related, but it feels that way.

1332
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:12,870
Hmm,

1333
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:14,430
did you see this?

1334
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,120
I'll play a clip out of the blue
which is up from my series on

1335
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:23,550
the vaccine delivery. Okay. Uh,
this one I found peculiar. This

1336
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:32,490
is a Dr. Torres or as our friend
Jose pronounces his doctor. Yes,

1337
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:35,490
in fact, let me play the Medley
first before I even play this is

1338
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:41,190
this is this is it sounds like a
nbcs move to Guadalajara. This

1339
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:48,690
is. This is Dr. Torres medley of
Jose the host the the person

1340
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:52,980
that's running the show today,
yesterday saying his name he

1341
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:57,480
just love saying Torres and
Roland er. All right, which

1342
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:59,730
which one is Dr. Torres medley.

1343
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:04,140
Oh done. Okay, it's in a whole
different I'm sorry. I got it.

1344
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:10,230
Senior medical correspondent dr.
john Torres joins us. Just voted

1345
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:13,680
on recommendations for the new
vaccine including advice for

1346
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,370
pregnant women. And Dr. COVID is
the CDC is now seeing exactly

1347
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:21,150
how far apart these two shots
need to be. Dr. Torres, thank

1348
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,110
you very much.

1349
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:27,210
I couldn't even listen to the
report. I was so distracted by

1350
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:28,320
the third is,

1351
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:32,160
as the second is we actually
unfortunately a stepped all over

1352
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,890
the second pronunciation which
he exaggerated. Well,

1353
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:36,540
I want to hear it again can bc

1354
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:39,930
senior medical correspondent dr.
john Thoris joins us now. Dr.

1355
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:43,320
Torres, the CDC just voted was
on recommendations,

1356
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:48,150
including advice for pregnant
women. And Dr. Torres, the CDC

1357
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:51,300
is now seeing exactly how far
apart these two shots need to

1358
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,240
be. Dr. Torres, thank you very
much this

1359
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,070
Dr. Thoris. Did you like your

1360
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:57,120
total last?

1361
01:20:57,210 --> 01:21:02,820
Did you see the the Australia
vaccine? Yeah, this was That was

1362
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:06,660
good. But I know, I know what
happened. This is so tell us

1363
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:10,740
yeah. Brazil. So Australia had
developed their own vaccine. It

1364
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:13,320
is my belief it was an
attenuated vaccine. I don't

1365
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:18,930
think it was one of these mRNA
vaccines. And we know from the

1366
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,630
genome and the breakdown, or
we've been told what the hell do

1367
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:27,480
we really know that the COVID is
a SARS cov two virus has little

1368
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:33,810
bits of HIV in it, which is part
of the mechanism that uses to

1369
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:37,920
deliver the protein spikes into
the system, which is also why it

1370
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,280
makes it highly suspicious as
something that was not created

1371
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:47,160
in the lab. But in order to
deliver a vaccine and attenuated

1372
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:50,430
or dead virus, you've got to
have all pieces in it. And so

1373
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:53,640
that means you have to have
little pieces of HIV. And lo and

1374
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:57,810
behold, people started to show
up with testing positive for

1375
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:03,360
HIV, which Australia says are
false positives. So and then

1376
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:08,340
they stopped the whole fact.
That sounds like yes, sounds

1377
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:09,450
messy to me.

1378
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:17,130
Well, back to Dr. Total, as he
did say something in this. He

1379
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:20,370
went on about all the stuff that
everybody pretty much knows if

1380
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:22,890
they listen to any of these
reports. But he did drop this

1381
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:25,440
little bomb in here, which I
thought was interesting, because

1382
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:30,030
nobody's talking about this.
This is the this is during this

1383
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:34,500
moment where he's saying Taurus
and Taurus over and over. This

1384
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:38,130
is the Taurus report on 90 days.
Listen to this carefully.

1385
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:41,460
The CDC also recommended the
vaccine even for someone who's

1386
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:45,000
already had COVID, although they
could wait 90 days after getting

1387
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,700
the disease to get the shot.
Since in those three months,

1388
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:50,310
it's unlikely they'll get
reinfected with the virus.

1389
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,350
Wow.

1390
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:56,790
So that so that pay careful
attention to what he just said,

1391
01:22:56,820 --> 01:23:00,060
Well, I heard a couple of
things. But it sounds that if

1392
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:05,310
you've had it, then you can't
get it for another three months.

1393
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,260
But then you can get it again.

1394
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:12,330
Well, wait, here's what he said,
is kind of what you said. But

1395
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:16,440
what he said was that, should he
answering the question, should

1396
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:21,270
people who've had COVID get the
vaccine? Now, under normal

1397
01:23:21,390 --> 01:23:24,480
disease theories, you would
think that if you've had it, you

1398
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,350
don't need a vaccine? Oh,

1399
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:27,930
no, no, this is everywhere. This
is everywhere. They're all

1400
01:23:28,230 --> 01:23:32,430
they're all saying. And I have
Fauci. I don't know if I clip

1401
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:32,640
though

1402
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,820
they're promoting taking the
vaccine, even if you had it Oh,

1403
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:39,600
yeah. Then Then they say, This,
to me is extremely dubious. What

1404
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,780
does it mean? It means it's not
a vaccine, it's a piece of crap.

1405
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:46,890
That means something's amiss is
what it means. And so he says

1406
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:50,490
that, well, if you've had it,
you can wait 90 days and then

1407
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:53,370
get to move vaccine because
after 90 days, it's unlikely

1408
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:57,390
you'll get COVID. Again, us
which Kant's that or implies

1409
01:23:57,390 --> 01:24:02,040
that you'll get COVID. Again,
after having it 90 days later,

1410
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:05,550
which makes it what kind of what
is this? Or even after having

1411
01:24:05,550 --> 01:24:06,270
a vaccine?

1412
01:24:07,259 --> 01:24:11,909
Yes. Now, so this is very, very,
this really makes you wonder,

1413
01:24:11,909 --> 01:24:12,269
did you

1414
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:17,370
see the surfer dude explained
the Madonna vaccine.

1415
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,460
Yeah, you got that? Yes. It's

1416
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:24,840
very good. Because what he said,
I mean, he's clearly a he's more

1417
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:28,080
like a dude, let me tell you,
he's in front of a whiteboard.

1418
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:32,100
And he does it in two minutes.
And he I think it's spot on. I

1419
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:35,130
think he has it exactly right.
And it's worth listening to

1420
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:37,800
because it's the first person
not wearing a lab coat, or I

1421
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:41,640
think many went okay, I
understand what it's doing. I

1422
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:42,780
don't want that our

1423
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:46,080
genetic information can be
carried in three main ways. This

1424
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,080
first begins with DNA that
encodes the blueprints to make

1425
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:52,770
RNA that has the instructions to
make proteins, which are then

1426
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:56,070
going to function in every cell
in our body. Now, the Pfizer and

1427
01:24:56,070 --> 01:25:00,000
biotech or moderna vaccines
against Coronavirus. Focus on

1428
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,590
The second branch of this past
pathway mRNA or messenger RNA.

1429
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:08,250
Now this has been used in the
past for gene therapy, or for

1430
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:12,360
cancer treatment, but is now
being used for SARS COBie two,

1431
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:17,160
and the Coronavirus has 29 main
proteins, but the specific

1432
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,710
protein that's found on the
outer membrane is known as the

1433
01:25:19,710 --> 01:25:23,010
spike protein, which is really
important for to infect a

1434
01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:26,130
healthy cell. Now, what these
companies did is they looked at

1435
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:31,170
the entire genetic makeup of
SARS COVID, and found the single

1436
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:35,370
mRNA that encodes for the
instructions to make this spike

1437
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:40,290
protein, they isolated out this
mRNA that can now be injected

1438
01:25:40,290 --> 01:25:44,610
into us in the form of vaccine
to make one of these 29

1439
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:49,830
proteins, thus not giving us an
actual Corona virus. Now, this

1440
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:53,490
mRNA is important as it's been
structured, three prime and a

1441
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:57,270
five prime UTR, a coding region
and a place for the ribosome to

1442
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:57,720
start.

1443
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:01,350
This is literally gene splicing
what he's showing now and stop

1444
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:01,470
Well,

1445
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:04,170
you know, this is no different
than the explanation I gave that

1446
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:04,830
nobody No,

1447
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:09,150
no, no, you're right on. That's
why I, you are exactly right. He

1448
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:10,470
just adds a few more

1449
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:13,980
technical, more scientific, I'm
like to go ahead.

1450
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,060
I think it's useful

1451
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:18,570
and been packaged into a lipid
nanoparticle, which is critical

1452
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:22,530
for it to fuse with our human
cells, not allowing the vaccine

1453
01:26:22,530 --> 01:26:27,030
or mRNA to now enter into
ourselves, this recruiting the

1454
01:26:27,030 --> 01:26:30,390
ribosomes and initiation
factors. Since this RNA looks

1455
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:34,290
just like endogenous RNA that we
would make ourselves, it will

1456
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:37,890
then use amino acids that we've
consumed to build the spike

1457
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:41,850
protein. Now, that's when our
cells begin to say, Wait a

1458
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:44,520
second. We haven't seen this
protein before.

1459
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:47,400
Yeah, that's when the super
painful part comes in, or

1460
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:52,290
an immune response to bring in a
macrophage to come and destroy

1461
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:55,350
the cell that just got the
vaccine. But before the

1462
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:58,710
macrophage destroys the cell,
it's going to remember that this

1463
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:02,400
spike protein was different. It
was a foreign antigen, that it's

1464
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:05,820
going to send the information to
our lymphatic system, which is

1465
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:09,510
composed of B cells that are now
going to make antibodies against

1466
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:12,690
this antigen and T cells, which
are now going to be on the

1467
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:17,580
lookout for this antigen in the
future. So if we are newly

1468
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:21,480
infected with Coronavirus, the
antibodies that we've now

1469
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:25,290
produced are going to bind with
the antigen present on the

1470
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:30,060
outside of the COVID-19 and
direct the Coronavirus for

1471
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:33,450
destruction by macrophages
before the Coronavirus can

1472
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:35,490
infect ourselves. So what

1473
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:39,600
are you waiting for get in line
sounds good by the way. This is

1474
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,750
nice or sorry?

1475
01:27:42,870 --> 01:27:46,890
I think this is pretty screwy to
be honest about it but if it

1476
01:27:46,890 --> 01:27:51,810
actually if such say it works
and most people most being the

1477
01:27:51,810 --> 01:27:55,350
operative word Sure. I think it
will prevent anyone from ever

1478
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:56,880
getting the common cold again

1479
01:27:57,690 --> 01:28:01,770
well that's what they want
except it seems that it's one or

1480
01:28:01,770 --> 01:28:03,660
the other. I mean, how many Vax

1481
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:07,440
yeah there are boosters you do
know that trillions of dollars

1482
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,860
and cold remedies that would be
affected adversely by this

1483
01:28:11,130 --> 01:28:12,180
oh my goodness.

1484
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,320
Is that been taken into account
by any of these geniuses?

1485
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:23,940
Wow, that's a good point.
Because that is such well no

1486
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:27,630
that's all Yeah, that's a very
good point.

1487
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:32,640
I think it's it's destructive. I
think it's a destructive view. I

1488
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:35,970
mean, in terms of the if I was a
shareholder in a company that

1489
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:40,260
really relied on the common cold
for my my income, I would be

1490
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:44,250
very concerned about the value
of that company after this. If

1491
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:47,550
this thing works, let's just say
it works. Let's be on the be an

1492
01:28:47,550 --> 01:28:50,190
optimist. That's to say it
works. That means that all the

1493
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:53,490
Coronavirus is because they all
use that Corona that those

1494
01:28:53,490 --> 01:28:57,450
spikes all of them should be
disabled by this unless of

1495
01:28:57,450 --> 01:29:00,600
course it wears off or something
which is still the part that

1496
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:04,320
they won't talk about two things
one, if they've desist if the

1497
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,630
body is all jacked up about
this, and again, the

1498
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:09,330
coronaviruses are all over the
place in terms of the common

1499
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:12,660
cold and other things. So it
should never really really

1500
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:16,830
relent. If you continually fight
these off, it seems to me it's

1501
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:19,380
not going to wear off in 90
days, like they they're fearful

1502
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:23,220
of that's never been fully
explained to me. And the second

1503
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:27,870
thing which when we get to these
vaccination delivery stories,

1504
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:35,040
these this virus is started like
63 degrees centigrade below zero

1505
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,860
minus 60 degrees, which is 100.
Something plus minus 100 or

1506
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:46,590
more, very high, very cold. Do
they inject it cold? No.

1507
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:52,350
In fact, they give you a the
they give everyone a little kit

1508
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:56,400
and you have and the whoever's
administering the shot has to

1509
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:00,930
dilute the frozen it has to thaw
out for I think two hours. Then

1510
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:03,420
they dilute this because it's

1511
01:30:04,049 --> 01:30:07,829
I know they concentrate to one
yeah I don't like that either. I

1512
01:30:07,829 --> 01:30:10,529
don't want any kind of like
doing lab

1513
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:15,060
work some dude at Walmart is
mixing my vaccine. Yeah man good

1514
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:18,420
and and let's just be very
clear. This is going to be

1515
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:21,480
Madonna is the one you want.
This is being signaled

1516
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:24,120
everywhere. I know it's not the
one that's rolling out first,

1517
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:28,080
but you do not want the Pfizer
one because I don't know China

1518
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:31,620
pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and
its German partner beyond

1519
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:35,010
hackers saying that hackers have
stolen data related to

1520
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:38,850
development of their Coronavirus
vaccine in a cyber attack on the

1521
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:42,000
European Union's medicines
regulator. The European

1522
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,510
Medicines Agency has confirmed
they were targeted in a cyber

1523
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:49,050
attack but gave no further
details and the incident is the

1524
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:52,710
latest in a string of hacking
attempts against healthcare and

1525
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:57,540
medical organizations related to
the pandemic response. Reuters

1526
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:00,840
has previously reported on
allegations that hackers linked

1527
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:05,820
to North Korea, South Korea or
Iran, Vietnam, China and Russia,

1528
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:09,240
on separate occasions tried to
steal information about the

1529
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:13,680
virus and potential treatments.
Pfizer and beyond tech said they

1530
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,470
did not believe that any
personal data of trial

1531
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:20,160
participants had been
compromised and had been assured

1532
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:23,970
by the agency that the attack
will have no impact on the

1533
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:27,300
timeline for its review, which
is due to be completed on

1534
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:31,200
December 29. It was not
immediately clear when or how

1535
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:34,200
the attack took place, or who
was responsible.

1536
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:38,100
It noticed that she implicated
Iran, North Korea, China,

1537
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:40,560
Russia, everybody and then said
well, we don't really know who

1538
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,950
did it. But I think it did it.
It's just more messaging. It's

1539
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:47,670
like no, no, it's got to be the
Madonna make it Madonna people

1540
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:48,630
nothing else.

1541
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:54,450
That's interesting analysis of
and and for people who are

1542
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:55,260
stupid.

1543
01:31:57,450 --> 01:32:01,500
And this is as evidenced by the
governor of West Virginia is

1544
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,960
there's a couple things you
should not be doing but listen

1545
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:04,500
carefully.

1546
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:09,570
People to vaccine reminders are
just as the COVID vaccine will

1547
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:13,530
protect us from this virus and
save lives. There's no question

1548
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:14,250
no question

1549
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:17,790
clinical trials with 10s of
1000s of people have

1550
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:21,990
demonstrated that the
vaccination is how effective and

1551
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:29,730
safe these vaccines will require
will crap require to guide and

1552
01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:33,720
it is extremely it is extremely
important to receive but I think

1553
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,890
he just had the vaccine

1554
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:41,520
doses of this vaccine. You will
not be able to cross pollinate

1555
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:46,710
one or the other. You will not
be able to take one vaccine from

1556
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:51,180
the Pfizer and go to moderna and
do the other have to stay

1557
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:54,210
Pfizer, Pfizer or Madonna my
gunner I could only

1558
01:32:54,269 --> 01:32:57,509
I could only wonder what would
happen if you took if you took a

1559
01:32:57,509 --> 01:33:01,379
Pfizer first and then a Madonna
next you probably grow a third

1560
01:33:01,379 --> 01:33:03,209
arm as well right

1561
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:04,950
three months your dick falls off

1562
01:33:05,519 --> 01:33:09,629
and do the other you have to
stay Pfizer, Pfizer or Madonna.

1563
01:33:10,409 --> 01:33:11,879
Madonna Madonna.

1564
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:16,500
Another end of show cat
candidates Madonna,

1565
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,750
Madonna,

1566
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:21,900
Madonna, Madonna Madonna.

1567
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:23,670
And by the way,

1568
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,790
even when you take it, you take
another one you keep the mask

1569
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:27,360
on.

1570
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:32,910
And again again until you and
the people who live with with us

1571
01:33:32,910 --> 01:33:37,410
are vaccinated. Our best defense
goes back to wearing that My

1572
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:37,770
name

1573
01:33:38,850 --> 01:33:40,950
is famous doing the social
distancing.

1574
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:45,750
And that's not over you know,
the mask is not the mask. The

1575
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:47,610
mask is here to stay. Yes.

1576
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,740
So I've got two ISO clips. So

1577
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,750
unless magga prevails Yes.

1578
01:33:52,410 --> 01:33:56,460
I say this one. Oh, no. Ooh,
okay. Oh, no.

1579
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:57,870
I like it.

1580
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:01,170
And then met a lesbian.

1581
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:02,370
Have they ever met

1582
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,090
a lesbian?

1583
01:34:05,910 --> 01:34:12,570
juvenile but I it is low hanging
fruit. I'm liking it. Okay. I

1584
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:13,350
don't know if

1585
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:18,840
that's you want to go through
these vaccines? Yeah. Working

1586
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:19,710
out or wait?

1587
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:24,480
Oh, so everybody can enjoy it
all after we thank some people

1588
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:27,540
is that your you're thinking?
That's what I was thinking

1589
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:28,140
currently.

1590
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:31,500
Hold on. Let me thank you for
your courage and say in the

1591
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:36,210
morning to you the man who put
the seeds in? Well, two of them

1592
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:38,160
in vaccine john C.

1593
01:34:39,870 --> 01:34:42,330
Well, in the morning to you Mr.
Adam Curry. Also in the morning

1594
01:34:42,330 --> 01:34:45,570
all ships and sea boots on the
ground feed nears, subs in the

1595
01:34:45,570 --> 01:34:47,550
water and all the names the
Knights out there

1596
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:51,240
and we've got a whole rack of
trolls. Hey, trolls Hands up.

1597
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:55,590
Let me count y'all. Let me see
how many we have 2121 Ooh,

1598
01:34:56,490 --> 01:35:01,350
that's a magic number is the
inverse of 1212 Which was just

1599
01:35:01,350 --> 01:35:04,050
yesterday, special 1212 I like
it, trolls.

1600
01:35:04,170 --> 01:35:05,340
That's pretty astonishing.

1601
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:07,830
Good to have you all here in the
troll room at no agenda

1602
01:35:07,830 --> 01:35:11,610
stream.com where you can listen
to this show live on Sundays and

1603
01:35:11,610 --> 01:35:15,180
Thursdays, we have tons of shows
that are produced live, it's a

1604
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:18,090
two for one deal, you get into
the troll room. And you can all

1605
01:35:18,090 --> 01:35:21,720
can listen to the same thing at
the same time, often and it's a

1606
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,690
it's a real time stream. So at
least you're commenting on the

1607
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:27,450
same thing at the same time. But
it's also just fun, go in there

1608
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:31,110
and just go I'm a troll and just
run around and just say horrible

1609
01:35:31,110 --> 01:35:33,210
things and people will enjoy
your presence.

1610
01:35:33,239 --> 01:35:34,229
So what they doing there,

1611
01:35:34,559 --> 01:35:39,659
and if you are there, hit
everybody up and ask him for a

1612
01:35:40,169 --> 01:35:43,679
invite to no agenda social.com.
This is our federated social

1613
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:46,859
network. It's completely open
source software. There's no

1614
01:35:46,859 --> 01:35:51,119
algos hiding around, it'll try
and trick you into clicking more

1615
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:53,369
because you're angry, you pretty
much come in and you look at

1616
01:35:53,369 --> 01:35:56,519
your notifications. When you see
something you already seen. then

1617
01:35:56,519 --> 01:35:58,709
you're done. And then you can go
back to the top and there's

1618
01:35:58,709 --> 01:36:02,069
probably not going to be
anything other than pure

1619
01:36:02,069 --> 01:36:06,629
unadulterated signal to the
noise, no agenda, social calm.

1620
01:36:07,349 --> 01:36:12,149
And then we would like to thank
the artist who brought us the

1621
01:36:12,149 --> 01:36:17,819
artwork for Episode 13 102 1302
episodes. We titled that one the

1622
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:24,419
mink road. And this was a comic
strip blogger who came back with

1623
01:36:24,419 --> 01:36:29,279
a vengeance after many drawings
of butts and farts. He finally

1624
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:29,969
was the

1625
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:31,230
bus and hold on.

1626
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:32,460
Comic Strip.

1627
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:39,330
Comic Strip,

1628
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:41,940
comics jam,

1629
01:36:41,970 --> 01:36:42,720
comic strip,

1630
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:47,040
comic strip blogger, he hangs
out on no agenda social.com

1631
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:51,540
he submitted three or four
pieces that were all pretty

1632
01:36:51,570 --> 01:36:53,910
decent. We picked one. That's
pretty straightforward.

1633
01:36:54,269 --> 01:36:58,949
This was interesting. And it was
it was very straightforward. It

1634
01:36:58,949 --> 01:37:02,399
was a read Thought Bubble with
Chinese styled letters. That

1635
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:09,659
said that's what g said. Now.
Apparently, Scott Adams had seen

1636
01:37:09,659 --> 01:37:13,709
that on his Twitter timeline
earlier in the day. And it said

1637
01:37:13,709 --> 01:37:17,669
he was pissed that he hadn't
come up with it himself. Comic

1638
01:37:17,669 --> 01:37:20,819
Strip blogger emailed me and
said, just so you know, this

1639
01:37:20,819 --> 01:37:25,409
joke is eight years old. So He
resurrected an old joke right on

1640
01:37:25,409 --> 01:37:30,059
time it fit people loved it, and
a well deserved coveted album,

1641
01:37:30,269 --> 01:37:35,729
art credit for Episode 13 102.
Spot on. That's how it works.

1642
01:37:35,729 --> 01:37:39,419
You get the low hanging fruit
steal if you have to. Well, no,

1643
01:37:39,419 --> 01:37:39,629
no.

1644
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,390
It says public domain phrase

1645
01:37:42,420 --> 01:37:45,240
was a good phrase. And I had not
heard it, you would not heard

1646
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:45,450
it.

1647
01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:46,290
I not heard it. I

1648
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,700
thought it was fantastic.

1649
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:51,180
And just I don't know why Scott
would be upset. I mean, there's

1650
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:54,480
plenty of stuff you've done.
People do especially in chat

1651
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:59,490
rooms. But 23 and G was another
one that was another or she

1652
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:04,650
should be pronounced she 23. And
she Yeah, she was decent. But it

1653
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:08,070
was like the art itself was a
little all over the place

1654
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:12,870
looking. So that didn't work
out, um, by there was a lot of

1655
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:16,470
interesting pieces. That was one
of the days where there's a lot

1656
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:19,650
of I thought there's a number of
pieces that could have been

1657
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:21,990
accepted. So it wasn't like a
last

1658
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:25,050
No, no, no, no, we looked at a
number of them. And we had

1659
01:38:25,050 --> 01:38:25,530
agreement

1660
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:31,560
muslin, which is simple,
straightforward was upon. It had

1661
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:35,910
it had ramifications that would,
she said, had ramifications of

1662
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:40,140
the swalwell controversy, which
recovered extensively in that

1663
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:40,470
show.

1664
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:44,340
Yeah, it had, I don't know, but
sometimes the simplest things

1665
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:49,680
when and if you're using a
podcasting 2.0 compliant app,

1666
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:52,980
you will see not only the
artwork we're discussing right

1667
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:55,650
now flipping, buying the
chapters which you can

1668
01:38:55,770 --> 01:39:01,170
contribute to yourself. But Dred
Scott, who has taken on the role

1669
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:03,600
of the community chapter
managers or whatever people

1670
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:07,830
submit, he's managing it. He
started putting in other artwork

1671
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:11,460
from the from the art generator
that pertains to the topics in

1672
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:15,330
the shows but but weren't used.
And that's actually quite cool.

1673
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:19,740
Because artists make artwork
based upon the things we're

1674
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:22,740
talking about. In that very
episode. We choose one right

1675
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:25,590
after we're done. But there's
this whole slew of things that

1676
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:29,070
really go along with the topics
as now he's putting those in,

1677
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:31,230
which makes it fun. We got

1678
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:32,970
enough to do that with Yeah,
exactly.

1679
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:36,720
It's a very fun experience. new
podcast apps calm you can find

1680
01:39:37,170 --> 01:39:40,800
an app that will work for you. I
like pod friend, but there's

1681
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,250
hyper catcher and pod verse and
a whole bunch of different ones

1682
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:45,480
new podcast apps, calm

1683
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,940
and of course, something other
than Spotify.

1684
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:54,540
I'm gonna make my prediction
here. Joe Rogan show will come

1685
01:39:54,540 --> 01:40:01,020
back on the open podcast market
within a year within each Within

1686
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:06,180
a year, I don't think they I
don't think they can fill the

1687
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:10,260
orders for the for the ads that
they've sold them on. I think

1688
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:14,220
they need to do it. It's going
to be very hard for them to keep

1689
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:17,610
their advertisers happy. So
we'll see

1690
01:40:17,730 --> 01:40:21,180
anyway, because of the because
of the reach just going to Yes.

1691
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:21,690
And yeah,

1692
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:25,800
well, you know, the podcast, the
Spotify podcast app is poor.

1693
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:29,400
It's just a poor experience. And
I'm quite sure most people who

1694
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:32,850
use Spotify, let's use it to
listen to music. And if they're

1695
01:40:32,850 --> 01:40:35,550
listening to podcasts, they
probably already use something

1696
01:40:35,550 --> 01:40:38,820
else. So now they're going to
have to switch back and forth

1697
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:42,810
the video does not. It's my
experience with the video is not

1698
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:49,800
great. And I think on features
the podcast in 2.0, will kick

1699
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:53,010
everybody's ass. No Apple is
thinking of coming along with

1700
01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:56,460
us. But who knows they're,
they're there, I'm sure that I'm

1701
01:40:56,460 --> 01:41:00,720
quite sure they're going to do a
podcast plus and hire a bunch of

1702
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:03,570
high end people who will make
shit no one wants to listen to.

1703
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:07,320
And they'll put that behind a
paywall, because they think they

1704
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:10,830
have to compete with Spotify,
which I think is the wrong

1705
01:41:10,830 --> 01:41:14,130
thing. They should be on the
side of the creative people, the

1706
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:18,630
crazies, you know, the one that
you had in your ads? No, no, go

1707
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:21,990
ahead and try and be like
Spotify. Okay, we'll keep our

1708
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:26,340
40% of the market share out here
in the free on cancelable world.

1709
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,870
And that brings us to the people
we'd like to thank for bringing

1710
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:34,710
us their treasure in addition to
time and talent, because there's

1711
01:41:34,710 --> 01:41:37,320
no way we could be doing the
show we would be in fact

1712
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:39,870
canceled if we had
advertisements or corporate

1713
01:41:39,870 --> 01:41:42,810
money, because that would go
away very quickly. All you have

1714
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:46,530
to do is go bitch and moan to
the advertisers. And you get

1715
01:41:46,530 --> 01:41:48,660
canceled. That's how it works.
And we have our own

1716
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:51,060
infrastructure works. It's so
easy.

1717
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:54,390
It's a mechanism. It's
beautiful. Get the golf Yeah, I

1718
01:41:54,390 --> 01:41:57,150
don't like this guy won him off
the air. Yeah, to let me go

1719
01:41:57,150 --> 01:41:58,740
bitch and moan to the advertiser

1720
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:01,770
calling the Sleeping Giants
kids. They'll do it for you pay

1721
01:42:01,770 --> 01:42:02,790
him a little bit of money
though.

1722
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:04,050
about them.

1723
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:07,770
Yeah, they're still active.
They're still out there. So

1724
01:42:07,770 --> 01:42:12,630
we've really appreciate our
producers who helped us in a

1725
01:42:12,630 --> 01:42:17,040
financial way. And we'd like to
thank the ones who came in

1726
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:21,060
Bigley with an executive
producer, associate executive

1727
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:23,610
producer credit right in the
show kind of the way Hollywood

1728
01:42:23,610 --> 01:42:24,030
does it.

1729
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:28,890
Well, the top of the list is
Alexander Pellegrino for

1730
01:42:28,890 --> 01:42:34,680
$667.00. From San Diego,
California, I cannot find a note

1731
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:38,010
from Alexander Pellegrino and I
cannot find it might be

1732
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:41,910
something somewhere, but it's
not under the subject line

1733
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:46,080
donation. So I'm just gonna have
to wait for him to come along

1734
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:49,050
with something he wants us to
do. We're saying he might even

1735
01:42:49,050 --> 01:42:52,410
want to be anonymous, which is
really with this sort of thing.

1736
01:42:52,410 --> 01:42:56,850
He put something in that box on
PayPal, and some people well,

1737
01:42:56,850 --> 01:43:00,180
you know, you can't do on a
phone. Well, if you're gonna put

1738
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:03,750
in a big donation, you know, get
to a real machine and do it that

1739
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:05,370
way. If you want to be
anonymous,

1740
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:10,049
now he sent via PayPal. What do
you see? He sends it through

1741
01:43:10,049 --> 01:43:14,099
PayPal? Yeah, yeah, no, I don't
have anything from either. Well,

1742
01:43:14,099 --> 01:43:17,969
thank you very much though.
Alexander Pellegrino, Mr.

1743

Yay. Yay. This much.

1748
01:43:27,419 --> 01:43:31,589

Hey, guys. Hey, guys. I've been

1752
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,310
Convert good.

1753
01:43:44,730 --> 01:43:49,140
Another Tom Woods show. It was
perfect timing as I suddenly

1754
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:51,570
found myself with much more time
on my hands due to the COVID

1755
01:43:51,570 --> 01:43:54,360
lockdown. I'm embarrassed. It
has taken me so long to donate.

1756
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:57,390
I cashed out some Bitcoin during
the recent spike as a birthday

1757
01:43:57,390 --> 01:44:00,090
present. And myself which on
December 14, please add me to

1758
01:44:00,090 --> 01:44:03,300
the list. You're on the list, I
think. Yeah, we got a big list

1759
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:06,180
today. Yeah, I wanted to share
some of my favorite podcasters

1760
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:08,730
Adam and john, I appreciate you
guys doing the work exposing the

1761
01:44:08,730 --> 01:44:12,420
bigger picture that the M five m
seems to ignore or intentionally

1762
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:17,910
cover up. Question mark. Do they
cover it up? Or do they ignore

1763
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:18,600
it? I don't know.

1764
01:44:19,530 --> 01:44:22,260
Yes, the answer is yes.
unequivocably. He

1765
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:28,050
has one of the two Yeah, I've
been called a trapper and a

1766
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:31,620
conspiracy theorist since I was
a teenager in the 90s. It all

1767
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:36,360
started with Art Bell on Late
Night FM radio. My friends who

1768
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:39,930
used to make fun of me are now
asking for prepping advice.

1769
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:43,470
While water goes

1770
01:44:43,470 --> 01:44:46,380
up best Do I need to save salt,

1771
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:50,010
MRIs and blood clotting gauze.

1772
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:55,650
I hit a few blood car. Yeah, I
think there's a good one. I had,

1773
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:56,550
gosh,

1774
01:44:56,610 --> 01:44:58,110
I have that blood clotting.

1775
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:02,160
I bet you do. I mean If you have
them in the mountain is made our

1776
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:05,130
conversations so much more fun.
I don't have to worry about

1777
01:45:05,130 --> 01:45:08,040
saying something too far out. By
the way, this note is too long.

1778
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:11,460
I want to mention that to you
prepper. Bringing the

1779
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:13,950
conversation to a screeching
halt is interesting enough, I

1780
01:45:13,950 --> 01:45:16,200
can read it, but I've noticed
something. I wonder if you've

1781
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:19,950
heard of this before, it seems
when sheeple start to step

1782
01:45:19,950 --> 01:45:23,310
outside the herd and look at the
bigger picture. They go through

1783
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:26,220
almost a grieving process. I
think I went through this

1784
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:30,150
myself. At first, they're
outraged and lose themselves in

1785
01:45:30,150 --> 01:45:32,610
research trying to figure
everything out. Then they tried

1786
01:45:32,610 --> 01:45:36,090
to share this info with others,
but no one would listen. So they

1787
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:39,960
withdraw and go through a bout
of depression. Then they go so

1788
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:43,800
deep down in the rabbit hole
that they are consumed with fear

1789
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:46,830
and rush together their preps
after a while they become

1790
01:45:46,830 --> 01:45:50,760
overwhelmed, and they go and
they give up hope. Eventually

1791
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:53,550
they make it back around to
being contented just sit back

1792
01:45:53,550 --> 01:45:59,100
and enjoy the show. is where we
come in crazy. Exactly. Bingo.

1793
01:45:59,310 --> 01:46:02,280
You guys seem to have a way of
making the great reset in the

1794
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:08,280
New World Order funny. You know
why? Cuz it's

1795
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:10,530
funny. That's why

1796
01:46:11,370 --> 01:46:14,760
anyways, I keep hitting my I
keep trying to hit my husband in

1797
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:19,530
the mouth. Poor guy. He hasn't
taken the bait yet. However, our

1798
01:46:19,530 --> 01:46:23,040
three Human Resources don't have
a choice. No agenda is now

1799
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:26,520
required listing in our home
school. Yes, my tweens try to

1800
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:29,310
act like they aren't interested
but I catch them quoting the

1801
01:46:29,310 --> 01:46:35,940
message to get like I I can't
see him quoting the show all the

1802
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:40,710
time. Sorry, says shown I got
lost to get propaganda talking

1803
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:43,410
points. I'm sorry, show all the
time saying things to each

1804
01:46:43,410 --> 01:46:47,040
other. Like shut up slave. And
we're all gonna die. Even though

1805
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:48,270
we don't watch you're listening.

1806
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:52,950
By the way. That's the takeaway
from America's children is shut

1807
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:55,890
up slave. We're all gonna die.
We're doing a good job.

1808
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:59,580
Yeah, it's making it even
funnier. We don't watch or

1809
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:02,850
listen to any m five m in our
home. They still managed to get

1810
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:05,580
propaganda talking points from
their friends. Of course. That's

1811
01:47:05,610 --> 01:47:08,700
that's active friends. And that
was dangerous. Yes. Now, thanks

1812
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:12,690
to the no agenda show. They get
to hear the clips from the real

1813
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:15,660
news sources along with the
deconstruction It sounds so much

1814
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:18,720
better coming from someone other
than mom. Yeah. Which makes my

1815
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:21,420
job so much easier. Thank you a
couple of weeks ago, you joked

1816
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:24,180
about broadcasting your show
over ham radio. I have recently

1817
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:27,210
gotten my first radio, and I'm
studying for my technicians

1818
01:47:27,210 --> 01:47:29,130
license. Oh, excellent.

1819
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:30,720
And you'll be

1820
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:36,180
away quickly. Take a lot of the
take a lot of the tests because

1821
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:41,220
you Okay, I know, it's too long
for me to give you something.

1822
01:47:41,730 --> 01:47:45,450
here's, here's the tip, it is
important. All you need is the

1823
01:47:45,450 --> 01:47:50,670
FCC practice test for this year,
it will be the exact same

1824
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:54,540
questions and the exact same
answers as the real test. The

1825
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:57,450
only difference is the answers
will be in a different order. So

1826
01:47:57,450 --> 01:48:00,720
if you can, if you can get the
practice test, which is

1827
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:04,170
available online, you'll Ace it
because you'll know the answers.

1828
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,540
It'll be it'll the answers will
be there for you.

1829
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:09,540
Yeah, that's pretty much it. If
you can take the test over and

1830
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:11,700
over and over again, you'll see
which ones you missed. There's

1831
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:14,880
more questions available than
the ones you're going to get

1832
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:18,180
true. But they do give them all
to you. All the answers are

1833
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:21,600
available. All the questions are
available, they change it every

1834
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,840
year. And you just take the test
over and over until you nail it

1835
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:26,940
three or four times in a row and
just go do it.

1836
01:48:26,970 --> 01:48:28,650
It's kind of like the helicopter
test.

1837
01:48:31,650 --> 01:48:33,780
Yeah, exactly the same

1838
01:48:33,839 --> 01:48:35,699
license to learn how to fly.

1839
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:40,740
I'm trying to Can she continues
her note, per lengthy note. I'm

1840
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:43,590
trying to convince my friends to
get radios to so they will have

1841
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:46,200
a way to communicate when
censorship and cyber attacks

1842
01:48:46,230 --> 01:48:51,360
take down the internet. We will
all need no agenda more than

1843
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:53,700
ever. So I'm seriously
suggesting you figure out a way

1844
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:56,430
to broadcast over shortwave and
get it going. Now it's not

1845
01:48:56,430 --> 01:49:00,090
possible as sort of a backup
plan in case of emergency.

1846
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:03,990
Sorry, this note has gotten a
bit long. Okay. Just one more

1847
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:07,410
thing to I have a question for
Adam.

1848
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:07,950
Yeah,

1849
01:49:08,010 --> 01:49:12,030
I hear you refer to your wife as
the keeper. Yes. I always assume

1850
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:17,340
that you met she was the one as
in one you decided to keep. But

1851
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:20,790
with the recent talk of the
crackin keeper. I got me

1852
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:25,200
thinking maybe you mean she's
your keeper as an atom keeper.

1853
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:29,550
Which is it? No jingles no
karma. Just get on with the show

1854
01:49:29,550 --> 01:49:30,840
love in life. Sandra Walker.

1855
01:49:30,870 --> 01:49:34,620
Well, in fact, it is Jhansi
Dvorak who coined this phrase,

1856
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:40,830
after a during our courtship
mine in Latinos, when he learned

1857
01:49:40,830 --> 01:49:44,940
that she is an outstanding
minimalist suitcase Packer and

1858
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:49,770
immediately coined her as a
keeper. Yep. And as the

1859
01:49:49,770 --> 01:49:52,170
courtship continued, I
discovered there were many

1860
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:57,090
reasons she is a keeper. So she
is in fact a keeper. And yes,

1861
01:49:57,090 --> 01:50:02,310
she also was my keeper. But not
an across the way. Yeah, I

1862
01:50:02,310 --> 01:50:07,080
said she's the keeper. And the
reason I you're right I forgot

1863
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:10,020
the exact reason I knew I called
her that. But the reason was

1864
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:13,860
because there's something about
women that know how to pack for

1865
01:50:13,860 --> 01:50:17,250
travel, especially when they go
to Europe. They really are rich.

1866
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:21,750
They're there, you know, the
women who carry out a suitcase

1867
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:26,760
the size of a refrigerator with
full giant balls of shampoo.

1868
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:30,300
Those women should be dumped.

1869
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:36,180
And, and and you even you
proclaim this, you gave her the

1870
01:50:36,180 --> 01:50:41,730
keeper tag, despite being
extremely upset that I had found

1871
01:50:41,730 --> 01:50:44,970
love and was not going to enable
you to live through my

1872
01:50:45,540 --> 01:50:49,290
escapades, vicariously as a
eligible bachelor.

1873
01:50:51,180 --> 01:50:55,860
Yes, there's some truth to this
too. I will I'll explain what it

1874
01:50:55,860 --> 01:50:58,890
was Adam was dating all these
different women and he had these

1875
01:50:58,890 --> 01:51:03,030
ribald tales to tell me after
the show was over, and I was

1876
01:51:03,030 --> 01:51:05,940
getting a kick out of it. I
thought it was it was hilarious.

1877
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:08,760
And I was very disappointing
when he settled down.

1878
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:12,960
And Sandra, we really appreciate
you asking that question. Stop

1879
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,250
by anytime okay.

1880
01:51:15,690 --> 01:51:18,540
You've got karma.

1881
01:51:18,810 --> 01:51:21,990
I don't take the next one since
that was long. This is Emily

1882
01:51:21,990 --> 01:51:26,220
balls. 333 from Cottonwood,
California. Ah, dear john and

1883
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:29,550
Adam. Just got some jingles here
for terrible terrier karma

1884
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:32,550
science build back better for
someone else. This will be my

1885
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:35,550
first donation but the de dushi
and executive producer credit

1886
01:51:35,550 --> 01:51:43,470
will go to my handsome man. His
name is Adam. It's his birthday

1887
01:51:43,470 --> 01:51:46,830
this Monday, so please put them
on the list he is. This donation

1888
01:51:46,830 --> 01:51:50,220
will also be the start of his
journey to becoming sir Lemurian

1889
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:54,180
of Mount Shasta. Adam hit me in
the mouth last December when we

1890
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:56,610
met but I really started
listening in earnest in March

1891
01:51:56,610 --> 01:51:59,700
during the beginning of the
COVID madness. Keeping small

1892
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:02,820
amygdalae is a part of how we
stay together in society and

1893
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:06,300
that keeps trying to tear us
apart. As someone who has always

1894
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:09,570
felt overwhelmed by the super
apparent fakeness of the news. I

1895
01:52:09,570 --> 01:52:12,540
finally feel like I can pay
attention to what's going on

1896
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:16,860
without losing my mind. One less
uninformed or under informed

1897
01:52:16,860 --> 01:52:19,860
millennial Yeah, you may be over
socialized though we're not sure

1898
01:52:19,860 --> 01:52:23,550
yet. We have to run you through
the battery of tests. Thank you

1899
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:27,360
so much. Emily concludes for all
the work you do in the community

1900
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:30,180
of rational minded people you
have created Well, they really

1901
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:33,840
created themselves around us.
And thank you to my amazing

1902
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,140
partner Adam for always taking
care of me and our three

1903
01:52:37,140 --> 01:52:41,700
kitties. With T's kitties. We
are fearless and resilient here

1904
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:44,280
in Northern California Happy
Birthday to my love and Merry

1905
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:48,240
Christmas to all Emily ball of
Cottonwood, California.

1906
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:53,670
beyond your freedom

1910
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:21,000
Christmas gift.

1917
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:47,370
of 333. My wife and I listened
to your show and try never to

1918
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:52,320
miss an episode. We are part of
the liberal elite. Graduates of

1919
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:56,070
the top MBA program work in tech
and we're surrounded by people

1920
01:53:56,070 --> 01:54:00,060
who parrot the headlines that
you discuss on the show. We find

1921
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:03,150
it super valuable to have
counter perspective. We're

1922
01:54:03,150 --> 01:54:06,540

Dear john adams, thank you for

1936
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:07,320
reading my note. I was excited
to be executive producer however

1937
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:10,080
I can see my note read as an
advertisement rather than the

1938
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:14,130
spirit that it was intended. I
apologize I'm such a douchebag

1939
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:17,220
please de douche. Oh no he says
please do me No we can't

1940
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:20,310
do for that. This is how you get
induced for this and it's also

1941
01:55:20,310 --> 01:55:22,950
that's producers can call other
producers that we don't

1942
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:24,420

1946
01:55:34,110 --> 01:55:40,680
asked for you to hit my friend
Jeff. Yes, si si k in the mouth,

1947
01:55:40,710 --> 01:55:44,640
meaning he needs to be dished.
He's a douchebag

1948
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:45,480
Oh, okay.

1949
01:55:46,710 --> 01:55:47,400
I guess

1950
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:48,990
we can do that. I guess. Yeah.

1951
01:55:48,990 --> 01:55:52,980
And play. They don't eat me Bo
Jaiden for my son. The wine is

1955
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:09,030
have to give him my actual
address. It can't send it to a

1956
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:09,810
Pio box. It's

1957
01:56:09,810 --> 01:56:11,550
a wastage is way too valuable.

1958
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:16,170
Yay.

right honorable ambassador to

1964
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:47,220
the Netherlands. Mr. Curry. More
humor than most people imagine.

1965
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:49,920
No, it's I am listening to the
show since Adam was on Joe

1966
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:54,870
Rogan. Oh, this is not your
right or wrong guy. Not really a

1967
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:58,350
Reaganite because I specifically
went to the episode to listen to

1968
01:56:58,350 --> 01:57:02,310
what Adam had to say. Oh, well
as was the whole episode.

1969
01:57:02,849 --> 01:57:03,479
Yes.

1970
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:07,680
I lost track of Adam Adam since
the left countdown or I stopped

1971
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:11,220
watching I can't remember since
then I'm a frequent listener

1972
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:13,680
appreciating your media
deconstruction which is

1973
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:15,930
especially helpful in these
challenging times already

1974
01:57:15,930 --> 01:57:19,020
donated once but I couldn't
really follow up since the

1975
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:23,670
runner was severely attacking my
travel business. Ah, yes. But

1976
01:57:23,670 --> 01:57:29,190
now we were building back better
what possibly could go wrong? On

1977
01:57:29,190 --> 01:57:31,140
a serious that by the way,
that's the right voice.

1978
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:31,890
Yes.

1979
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:38,070
Look advisedly, go wrong. On a
serious note. The vaccine even

1980
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:41,010
what I might think of it will
hopefully save my business. So

1981
01:57:41,010 --> 01:57:46,140
thanks, Joe. Joe got to do with
it. Wow, can I have a new you've

1982
01:57:46,140 --> 01:57:50,850
got pharma for building the
business back better? A TPP jobs

1983
01:57:50,850 --> 01:57:54,630
karma for our staff and I don't
eat me Bo Jaiden coincidentally,

1984
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:57,780
just for the fun of it. Cheers
from trashed.

1985
01:57:57,870 --> 01:58:00,450
I think we can do that and I'll
even roll out the bill back

1986
01:58:00,450 --> 01:58:01,920
better for you. No problem.

1987
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:08,310
beyond your free

1988
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,870
you've got pharma.

1989
01:58:24,810 --> 01:58:26,370
I'm glad someone asked for it.

1990
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:34,710
chiseled distinctly is next with
260 dot 60 in Maryland. Please

1991
01:58:34,710 --> 01:58:35,370
de douche me.

1992
01:58:41,490 --> 01:58:44,220
I saw this note earlier. I got a
kick out of it. I know you'll

1993
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:48,270
like it. I found your show two
years ago after searching Apple

1994
01:58:48,270 --> 01:58:57,600
podcasts with the keywords fake
moon landing. I was instantly

1995
01:58:57,600 --> 01:59:01,950
hooked beautiful. I work as a
skilled Trek. Craftsman in the

1996
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:05,280
Maryland DC and Northern
Virginia area that time last

1997
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,740
year was anticipating the
starter restoration product

1998
01:59:07,830 --> 01:59:11,340
project at the US Capitol
Building. I was annoyed when

1999
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:14,730
they postponed it because of the
impeachment. It was then

2000
01:59:14,730 --> 01:59:18,810
supposed to begin in mid March.
But as you will know, Corona

2001
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:22,650
Hmm. Fortunately, work has been
steady in residential and

2002
01:59:22,650 --> 01:59:24,960
commercial construction sectors.
Unfortunately, I live in

2003
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:28,950
Baltimore where the newly
elected mayor Brandon Scott has

2004
01:59:28,950 --> 01:59:33,540
shut down all indoor and outdoor
dining until further notice due

2005
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:38,910
to COVID-19. Yeah, this caused
the city's tourism agency to

2006
01:59:38,910 --> 01:59:43,440
suspend its we're ready campaign
aimed at stopping the

2007
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:47,970
hemorrhage. That is the
hospitality industry. Right.

2008
01:59:48,570 --> 01:59:53,490
Ready for what? There isn't even
in person attendance at the

2009
01:59:53,490 --> 01:59:59,580
Ravens games. I would be remiss
if I didn't call out Rhino

2010
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:05,610
government. Larry butthole I'm
sorry, Larry butter being Hogan.

2011
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:08,880
We've had him we've had clips
from him on the show. He's a

2012
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:14,370
total douche for being a cuck.
During this pandemic, plan

2013
02:00:14,370 --> 02:00:18,360
Bowman plan democrats plan
demmick Thank you both for being

2014

lighting. Could you please play
you've got Corona Fauci is

2016
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:28,530
wheeze followed by orange.

2017
02:00:30,030 --> 02:00:31,740
Love to You.

2018
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:38,730
Especially

2019

Long Lake Minnesota nuts 250 ITM

the work Jcd I'm not a wine guy

2021
02:00:57,060 --> 02:01:00,060
but I took your advice in the
2016 Bordeaux and it didn't

2022
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:03,720
disappoint. Up be Christmas
knees, jobs, karma

2023
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:04,500

jobs, jobs and jobs. That's

2025
02:01:11,010 --> 02:01:11,640
karma.

2026
02:01:11,670 --> 02:01:14,610
That was a big hit. I got a lot
of responses from people saying

2027
02:01:14,610 --> 02:01:18,180
they really have been enjoying
their 2016 Bordeaux upon your

2028
02:01:18,180 --> 02:01:19,080
recommendation.

2029
02:01:19,890 --> 02:01:23,520
Not hard to do in any one year
started to do a blanket

2030
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:24,780
recommendation like that. Well,

2031
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:28,020
you did it. You did it my
friend. You are missing out like

2032
02:01:28,020 --> 02:01:28,290
this

2033
02:01:28,290 --> 02:01:31,170
been my experience. You know,
I've been stunned by some of

2034
02:01:31,170 --> 02:01:35,550
these cheap lines I bought.
Exactly beautiful. Mike. Mike.

2035
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:41,070
Sam is next on the list in San
Marcos, California. $200.33 as

2036
02:01:41,070 --> 02:01:44,970
we round this up, gentlemen, I
hope to get you in time for

2037
02:01:44,970 --> 02:01:48,180
Sunday show. I will listen live
which really happens as I

2038
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:50,880
migrate from San Diego to
Central New Hampshire after

2039
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,850
seven years of nagging my wife
to get out of this beautiful

2040
02:01:53,850 --> 02:01:58,080
weather. San Diego by the way is
the weather capital of the

2041
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:03,330
United States. Sorry, Florida
and go back to the cold woods.

2042
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:08,400
She finally jumped on board. I
don't know why she did that. All

2043
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:11,730
it took was a pandemic well,
California probably helped

2044
02:02:11,970 --> 02:02:16,500
losing our social life
homeschooling our kids on zoom,

2045
02:02:16,830 --> 02:02:20,790
and too near nervous breakdowns.
If you get this in time, it

2046
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:23,700
should be somewhere in Arizona
when you're reading this I we

2047
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:28,140
sold everything and bought a
nine room in across from a lake

2048
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:31,470
and tucked away in a quiet
little town. Oh, after we

2049
02:02:31,470 --> 02:02:34,290
complete our remodel, I'll send
in another donation so

2050
02:02:34,410 --> 02:02:41,820
shamelessly plug the end room
until now you gave me a big

2051
02:02:41,820 --> 02:02:45,480
bundle of karma for this road
trip. Until now. Oh, can you

2052
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:48,210
give me a big bundle of karma
for this road trip and the move?

2053
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:51,540
Thanks for keeping my amygdala
small cheers, Mike.

2054
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:54,779

2067
02:03:32,009 --> 02:03:35,489
Yeah, got some secret advice
2017 something you can't have a

2068
02:03:35,489 --> 02:03:39,449
blanket blanket recommendation
for but he has a kid Born in

2069
02:03:39,449 --> 02:03:45,629
2017 and he needed a wine so I
gave him one that was very

2070
02:03:45,629 --> 02:03:46,799
specific wine that we're

2071
02:03:47,070 --> 02:03:49,320
gonna keep it keep it until the
kids 21

2072
02:03:50,010 --> 02:03:55,470
Yeah, nice. And he also orders
in 2019 which is which is the

2073
02:03:55,470 --> 02:03:59,550
lunch buys which is a stunner if
you can even find it. For my

02:04:14,370 --> 02:04:15,480
I guess I'm cheap.

2079
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:20,880
Outside of the show's over all
value, I felt like I had to

2080
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:24,060
donate for the inside baseball

No, that's anyway, that

02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:27,000
concludes our list of executive
producers associate executive

2095
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:31,650
producers for show 1303 right.
Yes,

2096
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:33,839
it is indeed. Wow. 1303

2097
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:37,170
protesters Get out of my way I'm
busy.

2098
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:42,930
We really appreciate this. These
contributions from our executive

2099
02:05:42,930 --> 02:05:45,030
producers and associate
executive producers, you can

2100
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:48,150
probably display these credits
anywhere credits are recognized.

2101
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:51,450
And even IMDb, as you know will
vouch for and there's plenty

2102
02:05:51,450 --> 02:05:54,030
more you can point to to show
that it's for real, but also

2103
02:05:54,030 --> 02:05:57,690
know that you have truly helped
produce the best podcast in the

2104
02:05:57,690 --> 02:06:01,590
universe yet again, another
episode outside of the entire

2105
02:06:01,590 --> 02:06:07,620
take down canceled culture that
has become the the internet as

2106
02:06:07,620 --> 02:06:11,760
we push forward in our vow to
bring you the best

2107
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:15,180
deconstruction of mainstream
news anywhere in our 14th year,

2108
02:06:15,270 --> 02:06:19,440
we plow ahead, we stand on this
hill. And we would love for you

2109
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:21,990
to join us on the hill on
Thursday, because we're going to

2110
02:06:21,990 --> 02:06:25,260
have a lot more fun stuff to
deconstruct I just saw out of

2111
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:29,010
the corner of my eye. General
Michael Flynn calling for the

2112
02:06:29,010 --> 02:06:34,710
President to enact his executive
order. And you know, when he

2113
02:06:34,710 --> 02:06:36,990
does that on the money, honey
show, it's always going to

2114
02:06:36,990 --> 02:06:40,650
happen. So join us on Thursday
and support the show

2115
02:06:40,650 --> 02:06:42,210
boomerang.org

2116
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,340
slash and a all we

2117
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:46,560
ask for is your time your
talents and your treasure. You

2118
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:48,630
brought it in spades. We
appreciate it. Thank

2119
02:06:48,630 --> 02:06:53,370
you. formula is this. We go out
people in the mouth.

2120
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:11,130
Yo, okay, vaccines, everybody.

2121
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:15,270
So all the network's all
dedicating their whole shows to

2122
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:19,320
promoting the back vaccine
delivery is a major, major,

2123
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:22,650
major, major major. It's a it's
a greatest thing that's ever

2124
02:07:22,650 --> 02:07:26,460
happened to this country. Yes.
And of course, the real reason

2125
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:28,710
is to get people to take these
vaccines, because who needs a

2126
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:32,550
bunch of vaccines sitting there
on a cold storage forever? And I

2127
02:07:32,550 --> 02:07:35,550
think most people, I think the
majority of Americans will take

2128
02:07:35,550 --> 02:07:37,230
the vaccine, and we'll see what
happened.

2129
02:07:37,230 --> 02:07:42,240
And also, a big part of the
mission for this vaccine is if

2130
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:47,190
it works, which I'm sure it will
95% efficacy, they will be able

2131
02:07:47,190 --> 02:07:49,980
to roll out vaccines for
everything that ails you,

2132
02:07:49,980 --> 02:07:54,030
because this is the new
messenger RNA system. So what

2133
02:07:54,030 --> 02:07:58,200
you got, you got a problem you
got, like a week left foot,

2134
02:07:58,230 --> 02:08:02,460
we'll just vaccinate you for
that. It's gene. Basically it's

2135
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:03,000
gene Moto,

2136
02:08:03,150 --> 02:08:04,410
really a vaccination?

2137
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:09,990
No, it's it's it's gene splicing
It is truly is well,

2138
02:08:09,990 --> 02:08:13,260
it's not true. There's no
splicing going on.

2139
02:08:13,290 --> 02:08:17,280
No, but they they know but they
are it's that's not entirely

2140
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:20,700
true, though. Even the way the
kid explains it. They look at

2141
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:27,210
the sequence and they build this
one particular messenger RNA

2142
02:08:27,240 --> 02:08:32,490
which I didn't call it virtual
gene splicing. Now, except

2143
02:08:32,490 --> 02:08:36,060
that term, but gene splicing is
done through injection of

2144
02:08:36,060 --> 02:08:37,290
messenger RNA.

2145
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:41,310
gene splicing is done in real
time with the with a gene a

2146
02:08:41,310 --> 02:08:42,150
splice?

2147
02:08:42,990 --> 02:08:47,610
A Yeah, that's what plants you
know what neither neither of us

2148
02:08:47,610 --> 02:08:50,040
really know what the hell we're
talking about. Be honest.

2149
02:08:50,190 --> 02:08:52,200
And we're trying that we're ad
libbing our way through.

2150
02:08:53,550 --> 02:08:55,770
But it's doing pretty good. We
do

2151
02:08:55,770 --> 02:08:56,730
have clips, which

2152
02:08:57,840 --> 02:08:58,980
helps helps. Yes.

2153
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:01,890
So let's go on and let's get all
this dramatic. And by the way,

2154
02:09:01,890 --> 02:09:05,580
Jose here works on the weekends.
really wants to get get into

2155
02:09:05,580 --> 02:09:06,300
acting.

2156
02:09:06,660 --> 02:09:12,090
Oh really? Okay. Oh, this guy
that's the guy.

2157
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,160
Okay, so let's go with vaccine
delivery. Part one.

2158
02:09:17,490 --> 02:09:20,460
Oh, I can't wait. These are the
loading docks for tomorrow

2159
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:24,720
morning. Our record rollout to
begin workers today packing

2160
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:28,650
millions of vaccine doses here
at Pfizer sprawling plant in

2161
02:09:28,650 --> 02:09:29,730
Portage, Michigan.

2162
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:34,980
Today is truly historic day. For
seven. Realize the greatest

2163
02:09:34,980 --> 02:09:37,980
public private partnership in
modern times.

2164
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:40,950
United Airlines had already
flown in some of the shots to

2165
02:09:40,950 --> 02:09:44,340
the US from Belgium that
potentially lifesaving cargo

2166
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:47,250
carefully transported in
sub-arctic coolers.

2167
02:09:47,430 --> 02:09:51,630
The first batch is 6.4 million
doses for now. Operation warp

2168
02:09:51,630 --> 02:09:54,180
speed is stockpiling 500,000 of
those

2169
02:09:54,180 --> 02:09:57,720
and splitting the rest into the
first half delivered now the

2170
02:09:57,720 --> 02:10:02,280
rest in three weeks. 150 45
sites expect deliveries Monday

2171
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:05,730
425 on Tuesday 66 on

2172
02:10:05,730 --> 02:10:12,060
Wednesday, we think as early as
about three weeks from now, we

2173
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:16,710
can be delivering vaccines to
all providers, as directed by

2174
02:10:16,710 --> 02:10:20,430
the states overnight. The FDA
authorized Pfizer's vaccine for

2175
02:10:20,430 --> 02:10:23,820
emergency use writing that the
known and potential benefits of

2176
02:10:23,820 --> 02:10:27,360
the vaccine outweigh the
potential risks are people 16

2177
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:30,150
and older. Oh, notice that

2178
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:33,060
16 and older said there was a
couple of things that wasn't

2179
02:10:33,060 --> 02:10:36,540
Jose so you'll get the drama
yet. But big dead guy with the

2180
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:40,950
flat way and can to send a dress
that guy who they keep clipping

2181
02:10:40,950 --> 02:10:45,660
dude, the guy's a he's a guy
wearing military fatigues. cammo

2182
02:10:45,660 --> 02:10:47,760
By the way, keys were in combat.
Oh, this

2183
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:51,720
is operation warp speed. You do
understand what's the camel for

2184
02:10:51,750 --> 02:10:54,660
because the military is
distributing the vaccine.

2185
02:10:55,470 --> 02:10:58,710
So what again, I'll ask the
question again, there's a lot of

2186
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:03,480
Okay. All right. All right. Was
the doctor wearing a white coat?

2187
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:05,430
And why does he have to wear
that?

2188
02:11:08,790 --> 02:11:09,630
The blend in.

2189
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:13,950
Garbage

2190
02:11:13,980 --> 02:11:17,010
me. Wow.

2191
02:11:17,639 --> 02:11:20,519
You're very, very astute and
awake today. I like it.

2192
02:11:21,570 --> 02:11:23,850
Alright, it's good except to
Good evening. This

2193
02:11:23,850 --> 02:11:25,530
is an historic day. What

2194
02:11:25,530 --> 02:11:29,820
very well could be the beginning
of the end of the day, Jose. Oh,

2195
02:11:29,820 --> 02:11:34,140
he's fantastic. I bet he's gone
from voiceover work. The first

2196
02:11:34,140 --> 02:11:37,740
vaccine for COVID will be given
to Americans in less than 48

2197
02:11:37,740 --> 02:11:41,520
hours. The CDC today affirming
the FDA is authorization,

2198
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:44,850
putting in emotion. What will be
one of the biggest logistical

2199
02:11:44,850 --> 02:11:47,070
challenges since World War Two.

2200
02:11:47,370 --> 02:11:52,440
But let there be no doubt this
war is still far from over. We

2201
02:11:52,440 --> 02:11:55,860
hit new records on Friday for
deaths cases and

2202
02:11:55,860 --> 02:11:59,280
hospitalizations. Tonight, our
correspondents across the

2203
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:02,430
country are going to walk you
through every step of what

2204
02:12:02,430 --> 02:12:03,360
happens next.

2205
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:08,340
Is it possible that he's hearing
the the boom boom, boom, boom,

2206
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:12,270
boom, boom, boom, the opening
track and they just didn't mix

2207
02:12:12,270 --> 02:12:15,600
it in or somehow messed up. It
sounds like he's reading to some

2208
02:12:16,410 --> 02:12:18,330
bombastic audio track that

2209
02:12:18,330 --> 02:12:22,860
is missing. I don't know. I have
no idea. And we got the whole

2210
02:12:22,860 --> 02:12:23,160
clip.

2211
02:12:23,190 --> 02:12:25,740
Yeah, no. With Gabe Gutierrez in
Michigan.

2212
02:12:26,130 --> 02:12:30,090
FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn
says the agency did not cut

2213
02:12:30,090 --> 02:12:33,900
corners. We worked quickly based
on the urgency of this pandemic.

2214
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:35,040
Not because

2215
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:36,780
of any other external pressure.

2216
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:39,360
President Trump called it a
medical miracle.

2217
02:12:39,389 --> 02:12:42,599
This is one of the greatest
scientific accomplishments in

2218
02:12:42,599 --> 02:12:43,199
history,

2219
02:12:43,259 --> 02:12:46,919
but just hours earlier, he
slammed the FDA calling in a big

2220
02:12:46,919 --> 02:12:51,239
old slow turtle. today. Dr. Han
disputed reports the White House

2221
02:12:51,239 --> 02:12:54,959
Chief of Staff told him to clear
the vaccine on Friday or submit

2222
02:12:54,959 --> 02:12:55,919
his resignation.

2223
02:12:56,099 --> 02:13:00,299
The representations in the press
that I was threatened to be

2224
02:13:00,299 --> 02:13:03,569
fired if we didn't get it done
by a certain date is inaccurate

2225
02:13:03,629 --> 02:13:04,199
for now,

2226
02:13:04,290 --> 02:13:06,840
as Operation warp speed kicks
into high gear.

2227
02:13:07,050 --> 02:13:10,950
The latest projection is 40
million doses delivered by the

2228
02:13:10,980 --> 02:13:11,970
end of the month.

2229
02:13:12,660 --> 02:13:15,630
But gage joins us live from the
Pfizer plant in Michigan. Gabe

2230
02:13:15,630 --> 02:13:18,690
you said Pfizer is holding back
half of the supply Why?

2231
02:13:19,049 --> 02:13:22,499
Yeah, Jose at least initially
operation warp speed is holding

2232
02:13:22,499 --> 02:13:26,609
about 500,000 doses in an
emergency preserved about half

2233
02:13:26,609 --> 02:13:29,909
of the rest will be sent out in
about three weeks. That's to

2234
02:13:29,909 --> 02:13:33,749
make sure that everyone who gets
a first dose okay.

2235
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:39,030
If I were running Joe Biden, you
know cuz he clearly you have to

2236
02:13:39,030 --> 02:13:43,350
program him. If I was running
him, I would have him out on the

2237
02:13:43,350 --> 02:13:48,990
tarmac near see 130 you know,
like pointing his finger. like

2238
02:13:48,990 --> 02:13:52,020
yeah, that's me, man. I'm doing
he should just take credit for

2239
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:55,440
it. Just jump in there right now
and just pointed guys in army

2240
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:57,660
fatigues loading loading the
vaccine.

2241
02:13:59,190 --> 02:14:01,740
They should just do it. He's too
old. He's actually I think

2242
02:14:01,740 --> 02:14:03,840
legitimately afraid of getting
COVID

2243
02:14:04,469 --> 02:14:06,809
Well, that's why he has two
masks on Yeah, he's always

2244
02:14:06,809 --> 02:14:07,439
doubled up.

2245
02:14:09,630 --> 02:14:12,450
So that none of this sort of
thing is going to work with him.

2246
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:15,450
That's too bad because it's a
great opportunity. Now Trump's

2247
02:14:15,450 --> 02:14:16,470
gonna do it. Hello.

2248
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,760
All right, let's go to part
three of this nutty report.

2249
02:14:20,790 --> 02:14:24,330
Transforming the vaccine will be
an unprecedented challenge this

2250
02:14:24,540 --> 02:14:29,130
massive high tech task to store
ship and track it on the way to

2251
02:14:29,130 --> 02:14:29,370
where

2252
02:14:29,370 --> 02:14:33,480
you live. In this mission. Every
second counts organ chesky

2253
02:14:33,480 --> 02:14:37,170
reports from the UPS worldport
air hub in Louisville, Kentucky.

2254
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:40,200
Tonight shipping giants
nationwide ready to roll out

2255
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:42,210
Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine,

2256
02:14:42,510 --> 02:14:46,290
the next 24 hours crucial. The
first dose is moving from a

2257
02:14:46,290 --> 02:14:49,830
Pfizer plant in Michigan, to
FedEx and UPS hubs like Memphis,

2258
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:53,910
Tennessee and Louisville,
Kentucky before going out to 636

2259
02:14:53,910 --> 02:14:58,470
locations nationwide. Ups mostly
covering the East Coast while

2260
02:14:58,470 --> 02:15:02,040
FedEx primarily covers the
world. Historic I mean, this is

2261
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:04,260
a monumental event.

2262
02:15:04,799 --> 02:15:08,759
I believe as a company, it may
be our finest hour. Richard

2263
02:15:08,759 --> 02:15:11,909
Smith is the regional president
for FedEx America's covering

2264
02:15:11,909 --> 02:15:15,119
every domestic delivery. He says
the company is using real time

2265
02:15:15,119 --> 02:15:19,049
tracking to follow every vaccine
shipment from start to finish.

2266
02:15:19,319 --> 02:15:21,539
There is a distribution that's
essentially

2267
02:15:21,749 --> 02:15:26,159
broken down into different
states different metropolitan

2268
02:15:26,159 --> 02:15:31,289
areas, we'll go to FedEx versus
ups. But we're prepared to

2269
02:15:31,289 --> 02:15:33,989
deliver from anywhere to
anywhere on a time definite

2270
02:15:33,989 --> 02:15:35,009
basis overnight,

2271
02:15:35,190 --> 02:15:40,050
just as we do every, every day
out there ups using a similar

2272
02:15:40,050 --> 02:15:44,130
strategy, or we can be very,
very agile and how we handle any

2273
02:15:44,310 --> 02:15:47,040
kind of shipments coming into
local ups healthcare

2274
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:50,010
president Wes Wheeler says each
box like these that went to

2275
02:15:50,010 --> 02:15:54,030
Canada, not only packed with dry
ice, but a Bluetooth device

2276
02:15:54,030 --> 02:15:56,310
tracking at sub freezing
temperature and

2277
02:15:56,340 --> 02:15:59,370
active location. Every time the
package hits one of our

2278
02:15:59,370 --> 02:16:02,280
locations anywhere in the
country, it will be able to see

2279
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:05,670
it and will be able to monitor
its location. And if we get

2280
02:16:05,670 --> 02:16:08,130
stuck for whatever reason, we
can recover.

2281
02:16:08,969 --> 02:16:13,109
The one question that is not
answered in all of this.

2282
02:16:14,789 --> 02:16:17,939
logistics, which just sound My
goodness, have we ever seen

2283
02:16:17,939 --> 02:16:20,249
anything like this before? I
mean, I want to know, do we

2284
02:16:20,249 --> 02:16:22,649
still get our two day free
shake?

2285
02:16:23,070 --> 02:16:27,060
They make it go? Apparently not.
I went to the post office box.

2286
02:16:27,210 --> 02:16:31,140
There was nothing in there. And
by the way, when he says, Well,

2287
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:35,010
if something happens, we can
recover. What is he talking

2288
02:16:35,010 --> 02:16:37,410
about? If you listen to at the
end of that last clip, again,

2289
02:16:37,590 --> 02:16:40,200
explain what he's talking about?
Well, that's

2290
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:42,510
an interesting point, hold on a
second, let me just get to the

2291
02:16:42,510 --> 02:16:43,380
very end. They're

2292
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:46,980
packed with dry ice. But a
Bluetooth device tracking its

2293
02:16:46,980 --> 02:16:49,740
sub freezing temperature and
active location,

2294
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:52,980
every time the package hits one
of our locations anywhere in the

2295
02:16:52,980 --> 02:16:56,100
country. And we'll be able to
see it. And we'll be able to

2296
02:16:56,100 --> 02:16:59,910
monitor its location. And if we
get stuck for whatever reason we

2297
02:16:59,910 --> 02:17:00,540
can recover.

2298
02:17:02,790 --> 02:17:06,180
I guess I think what he means is
it's just they know where it is.

2299
02:17:06,180 --> 02:17:09,510
And if it gets stuck, because
it's tracked with some it's with

2300
02:17:09,540 --> 02:17:11,880
what are those things called?
The

2301
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:14,370
tags. Usually they're using
Bluetooth, yes. Just

2302
02:17:14,370 --> 02:17:18,630
like, just like the tag. It's
just the enterprise resource

2303
02:17:18,630 --> 02:17:22,740
allocation tracker. Whoo. Oh,
crap. For us. It's so

2304
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:23,490
impressive.

2305
02:17:24,660 --> 02:17:27,720
By the way, this is the whole
show, except for one little

2306
02:17:27,720 --> 02:17:30,720
segment at the end is pretty
much about this. And they're

2307
02:17:30,720 --> 02:17:34,290
dramatizing. Oh, and I have two
more clips. They're drew and

2308
02:17:34,290 --> 02:17:37,590
especially the last one is a
real gem. The they're

2309
02:17:37,590 --> 02:17:40,080
dramatizing this, and they're
really trying to I think that

2310
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:43,230
all the networks are doing this
the drill like give everyone a

2311
02:17:43,290 --> 02:17:46,890
Oh, great to COVID thing is over
which of course, Biden's gonna

2312
02:17:46,890 --> 02:17:52,320
be Jenny after January 20. to
definitely be over. It's just a

2313
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:56,460
it's just watching this rollout
as this amazing piece of

2314
02:17:56,460 --> 02:18:00,300
propaganda that is pretty much
overdue

2315
02:18:00,300 --> 02:18:04,230
you do you see it? Before you
play clip for Do you feel that?

2316
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:08,460
Indeed, this will be over when
Bo Jaiden comes into office?

2317
02:18:08,460 --> 02:18:11,160
Because I don't see that? Why
would they they got a good thing

2318
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:11,970
going here?

2319
02:18:12,450 --> 02:18:15,180
Well, they got they got it.
Yeah, I agree they have a good

2320
02:18:15,180 --> 02:18:19,470
thing going on the one hand, but
I think if they can dramatize

2321
02:18:19,470 --> 02:18:24,510
this, this vaccine ending to
this problem and get to you

2322
02:18:24,510 --> 02:18:29,880
know, they can't do big CEOs of
the airline companies and every

2323
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:33,450
travel industry in the
hospitality industry in the

2324
02:18:33,450 --> 02:18:36,000
service industry, which is what
all we really do in this

2325
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,280
country. And even the
manufacturing industry, they're

2326
02:18:38,280 --> 02:18:41,970
not going to put up with this
much longer. They gotta end this

2327
02:18:41,970 --> 02:18:44,220
and it's going to end this is
why they're dramatizing this.

2328
02:18:44,220 --> 02:18:50,610
This is over a January 20. It's
downhill February 1, everybody's

2329
02:18:50,610 --> 02:18:54,570
back in you know back not
wearing masks. Oh, no, no, no,

2330
02:18:54,570 --> 02:18:55,080
no, no,

2331
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:59,730
no, no, no, no, we're due for
100 days of masking up. Come on,

2332
02:18:59,730 --> 02:19:01,470
man. Okay, well, come

2333
02:19:01,470 --> 02:19:03,540
on, man. You're right. There's
gonna be 100 days of mass

2334
02:19:03,540 --> 02:19:06,720
wearing and then it's over after
that, but it'll be over on

2335
02:19:06,720 --> 02:19:09,900
January 20. And the way I'm
seeing the way I'm

2336
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:13,590
seeing it, the great reset is
bigger than Joe Biden. They'll

2337
02:19:13,590 --> 02:19:16,680
keep this running as long as
they need to until they take

2338
02:19:16,680 --> 02:19:19,830
care of business and really
destroy everything. Yeah,

2339
02:19:19,830 --> 02:19:20,100
they're

2340
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:22,950
a bunch of dead gray reset guys.
Idiot. Yeah,

2341
02:19:22,980 --> 02:19:25,560
well, let's go with they're
pushing it man. They're pushing

2342
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:26,070
it for

2343
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:29,940
tonight. After 10 months of so
much despair, new light at the

2344
02:19:29,940 --> 02:19:33,570
end of a very dark tunnel for
healthcare workers. It comes as

2345
02:19:33,570 --> 02:19:37,530
a nation sites deadliest week
since April, more than 15,000

2346
02:19:37,530 --> 02:19:41,760
new deaths nationwide, nearly
200 hospitals capacity and

2347
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:46,380
almost one third are seeing more
than 80% of ICU beds occupied

2348
02:19:46,470 --> 02:19:46,890
things.

2349
02:19:48,750 --> 02:19:53,880
This virus is so it's so serious
and people don't see it that

2350
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:54,360
way.

2351
02:19:54,540 --> 02:19:57,630
from coast to coast hospitals
have been preparing to roll out

2352
02:19:57,630 --> 02:20:00,900
the vaccine for weeks. In
Phoenix, this Healthcare System

2353
02:20:00,900 --> 02:20:04,470
doing a practice drill in
Louisiana, Austin or health

2354
02:20:04,470 --> 02:20:08,220
making sure their storage unit
is ready for the nearly 10,000

2355
02:20:08,220 --> 02:20:09,480
doses heading their way.

2356
02:20:09,990 --> 02:20:11,100
Those vaccines will go

2357
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:15,690
into these containers that are
cold storage. So many frontline

2358
02:20:15,690 --> 02:20:19,110
workers now breathing a sigh of
relief after living in fear of

2359
02:20:19,110 --> 02:20:21,870
contracting the virus and
passing it on to their own

2360
02:20:21,870 --> 02:20:22,560
families.

2361
02:20:22,590 --> 02:20:26,100
I've had doctors come up and
tell me I've not seen my parents

2362
02:20:26,130 --> 02:20:27,600
in in six months. I'm

2363
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:28,680
afraid to go home.

2364
02:20:28,770 --> 02:20:32,250
Dr. Paul nee works at Danbury
Hospital in Connecticut, where

2365
02:20:32,250 --> 02:20:36,720
some 700 medical staff signed up
for the vaccine in less than 24

2366
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:37,350
hours.

2367
02:20:38,400 --> 02:20:40,140
Yeah, ma'am.

2368
02:20:40,230 --> 02:20:44,130
All right, that by the way,
after they this clip went on a

2369
02:20:44,130 --> 02:20:47,400
lot longer, they brought in the
last of the sob stories to

2370
02:20:47,400 --> 02:20:52,380
people who died in a girl crying
It was really kind of did they

2371
02:20:52,380 --> 02:20:52,950
heartening? Did

2372
02:20:52,950 --> 02:20:56,250
they ask did they ask anyone?
How does it feel to have your

2373
02:20:56,250 --> 02:21:00,420
grandma died? Just before the
vaccine came out? Does it feel

2374
02:21:00,420 --> 02:21:03,570
like crap that you just missed
it that she just had to share

2375
02:21:03,570 --> 02:21:03,990
man

2376
02:21:04,020 --> 02:21:08,400
Auntie share. So disgust By the
way, so I got a new note from

2377
02:21:08,400 --> 02:21:12,900
one of our producers last night
about I guess one of the

2378
02:21:12,900 --> 02:21:16,650
hospital local hospitals is one
of our policemen, producers. He

2379
02:21:16,650 --> 02:21:21,750
knows who he is. The one of the
hospitals are going on strike.

2380
02:21:22,260 --> 02:21:23,520
Because why? Because they don't

2381
02:21:23,670 --> 02:21:24,420
they haven't paid

2382
02:21:24,420 --> 02:21:26,880
the nurses and they don't have
enough patience.

2383
02:21:27,779 --> 02:21:31,979
That's the real reason it seems
Yeah. Yes.

2384
02:21:32,100 --> 02:21:35,340
Okay. Whatever you do, just
listen to your news. It's all

2385
02:21:35,340 --> 02:21:35,910
true.

2386
02:21:37,050 --> 02:21:40,590
So let's go to the real kicker
to this whole thing was at the

2387
02:21:40,620 --> 02:21:45,810
end, we take a COVID moment. And
Jose gets to be as dramatic self

2388
02:21:45,810 --> 02:21:49,650
and do a kind of a soliloquy on
and you really tell us how

2389
02:21:49,650 --> 02:21:52,860
important all this is and what
we have to look forward to our

2390
02:21:52,860 --> 02:21:53,190
ladies

2391
02:21:53,190 --> 02:21:56,670
and gentlemen, NBC with Jose and
a COVID moment.

2392
02:21:57,930 --> 02:22:01,470
We want to take a moment to
pause and note that with this

2393
02:22:01,470 --> 02:22:04,950
vaccine, something truly big is
happening. Something that could

2394
02:22:04,950 --> 02:22:06,660
change the course of history.

2395
02:22:09,750 --> 02:22:12,480
achievements before. Yeah, stop.

2396
02:22:12,510 --> 02:22:13,140
Yes.

2397
02:22:13,470 --> 02:22:17,940
It started over. I didn't
realize until I just heard it

2398
02:22:17,940 --> 02:22:20,730
again. He's doing William
Shatner.

2399
02:22:22,020 --> 02:22:26,400
Oh, you didn't realize he was
acting like like, like Captain

2400
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:26,910
Kirk.

2401
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:30,810
I did not until this last play.
Yeah.

2402
02:22:31,050 --> 02:22:34,440
Because he's comparing it to the
moon shot. And apparently Star

2403
02:22:34,440 --> 02:22:37,740
Trek viewtiful just as real as
Star Trek, everybody who

2404
02:22:37,740 --> 02:22:40,170
want to take a moment to pause
and note.

2405
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:44,490
While we're talking broadcasting
stuff, what is this?

2406
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:45,390
We want to take?

2407
02:22:46,440 --> 02:22:51,210
What is that? What is this
opening sentence? Who do you

2408
02:22:51,210 --> 02:22:53,040
want to take? My goodness?

2409
02:22:53,070 --> 02:22:56,580
Do you want to take a moment to
pause and do one? Do you want

2410
02:22:56,640 --> 02:23:00,120
vaccine something truly big is
happening something that could

2411
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:01,770
change the course of history?

2412
02:23:03,420 --> 02:23:06,030
We've had big scientific
achievements before

2413
02:23:06,990 --> 02:23:08,070
often set off with a

2414
02:23:08,070 --> 02:23:13,290
bang. This achievement packed in
tiny vials no less spectacular.

2415
02:23:13,620 --> 02:23:18,180
But now it's on us. put us in
some historical perspective.

2416
02:23:18,180 --> 02:23:18,300
What

2417
02:23:18,300 --> 02:23:20,340
is this stack up alongside?

2418
02:23:21,150 --> 02:23:25,470
You look over the decades at
tests of America like the world

2419
02:23:25,470 --> 02:23:28,620
war two effort or the moon
landing program. These things

2420
02:23:28,620 --> 02:23:32,370
show how well we did as a
society. And I think we were

2421
02:23:32,370 --> 02:23:36,000
about to see that right now, as
we see whether this vaccine

2422
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:39,750
works and whether it will be
distributed to everyone. It took

2423
02:23:39,780 --> 02:23:44,310
25 years to develop a vaccine
for polio 12 years for the flu.

2424
02:23:44,580 --> 02:23:48,960
This first COVID vaccine took
just 11 months, the scientists

2425
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:52,170
should be celebrated. This is
probably one of the greatest

2426
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:53,940
public health accomplishments in

2427
02:23:53,940 --> 02:23:54,870
my lifetime.

2428
02:23:55,050 --> 02:23:59,250
But so too should the volunteers
10s of 1000s across the world

2429
02:23:59,250 --> 02:24:03,480
who rolled up their sleeves to
take their shot at helping 100

2430
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:07,890
years from now historians will
look back on this year and say,

2431
02:24:08,070 --> 02:24:11,820
did we Americans meet our mama?
I hope they say that we did.

2432
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:22,050
Oh man and you know, just like
the previous pandemic 100 years

2433
02:24:22,050 --> 02:24:26,850
ago, we will remember the heroes
such as typhoid Mary,

2434
02:24:28,110 --> 02:24:32,190
there will be a Floyd will be if
they don't remember any heroes

2435
02:24:32,910 --> 02:24:38,700
from any of that. Yeah, the
vaccine it's it's just as real

2436
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:39,660
as the moon landing.

2437
02:24:39,720 --> 02:24:41,010
It's the same thing.

2438
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:44,430
I gotcha.

2439
02:24:44,519 --> 02:24:48,509
I gotcha For a second there.
Almost many of our producers

2440
02:24:48,509 --> 02:24:53,039
work in health care and they are
being mandated many of them to

2441
02:24:53,219 --> 02:24:57,779
take the vaccine. And with this
first round of vaccines and I

2442
02:24:57,779 --> 02:25:00,779
have a feeling it's for it might
be for everyone. buddy who takes

2443
02:25:00,779 --> 02:25:06,899
this first, first plunge in the
arm, you will receive the V safe

2444
02:25:06,899 --> 02:25:11,219
app. And the V safe app is being
distributed to everyone who has

2445
02:25:11,219 --> 02:25:14,369
taken the vaccine and you'll
enter your vaccine number. And

2446
02:25:14,369 --> 02:25:15,869
you'll keep track of everything.

2447
02:25:15,900 --> 02:25:19,110
Texas hospitals are expected to
get their first doses as early

2448
02:25:19,110 --> 02:25:21,750
as next Monday, Travis County
hospitals will get more than

2449
02:25:21,750 --> 02:25:26,190
13,000 and almost 3000 more will
go to hospitals in Williamson

2450
02:25:26,190 --> 02:25:28,830
and Hayes counties. Today the
state announced once people

2451
02:25:28,830 --> 02:25:31,440
start getting those vaccines it
will use an app to track side

2452
02:25:31,440 --> 02:25:34,650
effects. It's called v safe,
it'll help people log potential

2453
02:25:34,650 --> 02:25:38,190
problems that could be sent to
the CBC. And it will also remind

2454
02:25:38,190 --> 02:25:41,400
them of when they need to get a
second dose about three weeks

2455
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:42,540
after the first one.

2456
02:25:42,630 --> 02:25:46,620
Yeah, it really it reminds you
every day and every couple hours

2457
02:25:46,620 --> 02:25:52,110
to report in is a super painful
yet I feeling dizzy yet or

2458
02:25:52,110 --> 02:25:57,000
whatever, whatever it is. And I
certainly hope this works. I'm

2459
02:25:57,030 --> 02:26:03,360
extremely skeptical of of this
newfangled technology. And the

2460
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:06,660
big problem is the people who
are skeptical these need to be

2461
02:26:06,660 --> 02:26:09,840
told to shut up and in the
United Kingdom whereas we know

2462
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:16,320
they are ahead of us. There is a
man named Neil Basu, he is

2463
02:26:16,320 --> 02:26:20,490
Britain's top counterterrorism
officer. And he called yesterday

2464
02:26:20,490 --> 02:26:24,330
for a nationwide debate on the
introduction of new laws to

2465
02:26:24,330 --> 02:26:30,390
punish people who spread anti
vaccination conspiracy theories.

2466
02:26:32,850 --> 02:26:35,760
The he said there should be a
discussion about whether it is

2467
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:39,870
the correct thing for society to
allow people to spread

2468
02:26:39,900 --> 02:26:44,520
misinformation that could cost
people's lives, as he responded

2469
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:48,660
to concern that false claims
online would undermine the take

2470
02:26:48,660 --> 02:26:53,340
up of COVID-19 vaccines. Now, he
did stop short of endorsing the

2471
02:26:53,340 --> 02:26:57,210
idea of new laws, but as
intervention will strengthen

2472
02:26:57,210 --> 02:27:01,140
pressure on ministers of
Parliament to act against

2473
02:27:01,140 --> 02:27:05,370
conspiracy theorists making
false claims about the vaccines.

2474
02:27:05,850 --> 02:27:11,070
This is a real problem. You
cannot have an opinion,

2475
02:27:11,250 --> 02:27:17,130
scientific or otherwise, that
goes against what you're not

2476
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:21,270
elected, but what your chosen
leaders have counterterrorism

2477
02:27:21,270 --> 02:27:23,910
cuz he's gonna call you a
terrorist a domestic terrorist,

2478
02:27:23,910 --> 02:27:29,310
I presume? Yeah, you can't have
that Google has now stated that

2479
02:27:29,310 --> 02:27:33,660
they will label or remove
anything that does not agree

2480
02:27:33,660 --> 02:27:39,840
with the conventional wisdom on
the vaccines, which should see a

2481
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:44,490
lot of more deep platforming and
shutting down we already saw an

2482
02:27:44,490 --> 02:27:48,660
animated no agenda get removed,
because we use Fauci his very

2483
02:27:48,660 --> 02:27:52,350
own words in his own voice,
actually. But now that's, that

2484
02:27:52,350 --> 02:27:55,920
doesn't matter. And the big
problem, so that's in the UK,

2485
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:58,560
and I'm sure we'll get to that
here. In the United States, we

2486
02:27:58,560 --> 02:28:03,960
have a different issue. And that
issue is is kind of twofold. And

2487
02:28:03,960 --> 02:28:10,050
we have a a movement, that is
telling us that because of

2488
02:28:10,050 --> 02:28:14,550
racism, black and brown
communities, as they're known by

2489
02:28:14,550 --> 02:28:17,490
the media, we just call them
places where people live, but

2490
02:28:17,490 --> 02:28:21,030
okay, it's black and brown
communities. And they have

2491
02:28:21,030 --> 02:28:25,110
suffered disproportionately.
Now, there are many reasons for

2492
02:28:25,110 --> 02:28:30,450
this. But according to the most
of the political landscape and

2493
02:28:30,450 --> 02:28:34,560
the media, it's because of
racism. And so we need to

2494
02:28:34,590 --> 02:28:37,680
encourage the black and brown
communities, particularly the

2495
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:40,680
African American black
communities, to get on board

2496
02:28:40,680 --> 02:28:43,110
with the shot because you're
dying, we got to save you, you

2497
02:28:43,110 --> 02:28:46,740
can't save yourself, we have to
tell you where the elites, the

2498
02:28:46,740 --> 02:28:51,180
American black community is very
skeptical of the government,

2499
02:28:51,420 --> 02:28:55,560
giving them something and
singling them out for it. And

2500
02:28:55,560 --> 02:28:58,470
you need to look up the Tuskegee
experiments to understand what

2501
02:28:58,470 --> 02:29:02,730
that is where they gave a large
group of African American men

2502
02:29:02,730 --> 02:29:06,240
syphilis, and then told him that
they were giving him the

2503
02:29:06,330 --> 02:29:09,630
vaccine, you know, a cure
against it and didn't and then

2504
02:29:09,630 --> 02:29:12,330
just followed them for 30 years.
President Clinton wound up

2505
02:29:12,360 --> 02:29:16,380
apologizing for that in the late
90s. So we need to go on we need

2506
02:29:16,380 --> 02:29:19,200
to propagandize and what do we
do? We got to call our people

2507
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:22,920
together. Let's call in the
National Urban League. This is

2508
02:29:22,920 --> 02:29:27,540
the most scripted, most phony,
most disingenuous thing I have

2509
02:29:27,540 --> 02:29:32,700
ever seen with Anthony Fauci.
But it started off with his

2510
02:29:32,700 --> 02:29:36,840
wife, Christine Grady, who we
have not heard from. Most people

2511
02:29:36,840 --> 02:29:40,650
don't realize that she is
married to him. They came in on

2512
02:29:40,650 --> 02:29:44,190
the zoom call from different
locations. They never said Hi,

2513
02:29:44,190 --> 02:29:48,270
it was never like she's my wife
or Hey baby, or Christine Grady,

2514
02:29:48,270 --> 02:29:51,180
just so you know. Her last name
could be Fauci, but it's not as

2515
02:29:51,180 --> 02:29:55,950
great No, not a mention. Not
even a wink wink. When she's

2516
02:29:55,950 --> 02:29:59,910
introduced Fauci is already on
camera. doesn't move. It's just

2517
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:04,950
If they have no relationship
whatsoever, and she is a

2518
02:30:04,950 --> 02:30:11,100
bioethicist, and her job is to
approve vaccines and other

2519
02:30:11,100 --> 02:30:15,840
biologics in the National
Institutes of Health based upon

2520
02:30:16,470 --> 02:30:20,310
their the ethical nature of it.
So this is really her road show.

2521
02:30:20,460 --> 02:30:24,660
It's her job to get black people
in America to take this and not

2522
02:30:24,660 --> 02:30:27,810
be afraid of stuff that has
happened to black people taking

2523
02:30:27,810 --> 02:30:30,630
stuff from the government in the
past. So she's brought in and

2524
02:30:30,630 --> 02:30:32,310
just listen to we have a
thankful

2525
02:30:32,310 --> 02:30:34,740
for the work that she does. And
we thankfully you can join us

2526
02:30:34,740 --> 02:30:35,730
tonight. That's a great,

2527
02:30:36,060 --> 02:30:38,370
thank you so much, Dr.
Frederick, and good evening to

2528
02:30:38,370 --> 02:30:43,260
everybody. As you heard, I'm an
ethicist at the NIH. My

2529
02:30:43,260 --> 02:30:47,040
colleagues and I and ethicists
in many other places, are

2530
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:51,210
intensively involved in thinking
about the ethics of vaccine

2531
02:30:51,210 --> 02:30:54,480
research, vaccine prioritization
and distribution and

2532
02:30:54,480 --> 02:30:57,870
utilization, the community
engagement and other things.

2533
02:30:58,290 --> 02:31:01,920
We're also very committed to the
ethical conduct of research,

2534
02:31:02,310 --> 02:31:06,420
research that respects the
dignity, the value and the worth

2535
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:10,380
of all people, and certainly
including African Americans and

2536
02:31:10,380 --> 02:31:14,850
people of color. We look forward
very much to listening and

2537
02:31:14,850 --> 02:31:19,350
learning this evening. From the
comments, suggestions, and

2538
02:31:19,350 --> 02:31:21,270
questions that the audience
brings.

2539
02:31:21,450 --> 02:31:24,660
I love that when they We look
forward to listening and

2540
02:31:24,660 --> 02:31:28,920
learning. We really want to hear
what you have to say while we're

2541
02:31:28,920 --> 02:31:31,530
stuffing your brain full of
propaganda

2542
02:31:31,590 --> 02:31:35,850
night. Now it is my distinct
pleasure to introduce the shill

2543
02:31:35,910 --> 02:31:40,260
and then turn over the program
to Ambrose lane, who epitomizes

2544
02:31:40,260 --> 02:31:44,220
the model of informed and
principled community based

2545
02:31:44,220 --> 02:31:48,390
health leadership. Ambrose lane
Jr. has over 35 years of

2546
02:31:48,390 --> 02:31:52,140
leadership experience as an
effective organizer, and

2547
02:31:52,170 --> 02:31:56,490
executive organizer. Elaine is
the founder of and since 2013,

2548
02:31:56,520 --> 02:32:00,450
the chairman of the Health
Alliance network, DCs largest

2549
02:32:00,450 --> 02:32:04,200
community health advocacy group,
advocating for issues of health

2550
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:07,800
equity, health policy, and
chronic disease prevention

2551
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:08,070
strategy,

2552
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:12,300
always noticed the equity word
in there. So he's being brought

2553
02:32:12,300 --> 02:32:18,210
in. He is, of course, a man of
dark skin color, because that's

2554
02:32:18,210 --> 02:32:21,330
what really works. And he'll
read the script till he is

2555
02:32:21,330 --> 02:32:24,540
also a co founder of the black
coalition against COVID.

2556
02:32:24,660 --> 02:32:26,100
Ambrose, over to you

2557
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:30,990
over to you so much, Dr. Grady
for that introduction. And I'm

2558
02:32:30,990 --> 02:32:36,240
going to introduce Dr. Anthony
S. Fauci. For our audience.

2559
02:32:36,390 --> 02:32:41,310
So he goes into a long winded
introduction of Dr. Anthony S.

2560
02:32:41,310 --> 02:32:46,320
Fauci. It's so scripted. It's so
obvious what is going on here,

2561
02:32:46,320 --> 02:32:49,080
but just when you thought it
couldn't get even more

2562
02:32:49,080 --> 02:32:52,380
condescending, Anthony Fauci
comes in,

2563
02:32:52,410 --> 02:32:57,090
in my understanding is that that
independent monitoring board has

2564
02:32:57,090 --> 02:33:01,260
African American scientists on
it. In fact, he works with you

2565
02:33:01,260 --> 02:33:04,560
directly. I don't know if she's
on the board, but we know that

2566
02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:04,860
we have,

2567
02:33:06,180 --> 02:33:10,590
which I love. In fact, one of
them, one of them, one of them.

2568
02:33:11,310 --> 02:33:14,010
Now, it's singled out, one of
them works with you directly.

2569
02:33:14,010 --> 02:33:16,530
That is that crazy. You work
with a black person. It's just

2570
02:33:17,820 --> 02:33:20,130
I don't know she's on the board.
But we know that we have an

2571
02:33:20,130 --> 02:33:23,880
African American science that
works with you directly. So this

2572
02:33:23,880 --> 02:33:28,860
is a talk, you can speak about
her work, but also the how

2573
02:33:28,860 --> 02:33:33,360
important that is in terms of
breaking down these myths in the

2574
02:33:33,390 --> 02:33:39,240
in the historic trepidation,
because it's a new day, it's not

2575
02:33:39,240 --> 02:33:41,730
1930 anymore. I've listened

2576
02:33:41,730 --> 02:33:44,280
to what Fauci says he really,
let's rip

2577
02:33:44,310 --> 02:33:49,860
2000. This is 2020. And so the
Times have changed. And the

2578
02:33:49,890 --> 02:33:53,610
input of African American
scientists in this process is

2579
02:33:53,610 --> 02:33:56,970
much deeper than one might
think. Talk about that a little

2580
02:33:56,970 --> 02:33:58,050
bit. Well, I

2581
02:33:58,050 --> 02:34:01,320
think the example that you gave
ambros is an excellent example.

2582
02:34:01,350 --> 02:34:03,030
It was also the one we rehearsed

2583
02:34:03,330 --> 02:34:08,790
the very vaccine. That's one of
the two that has absolutely

2584
02:34:08,790 --> 02:34:13,410
exquisite level 94 to 95%
efficacy,

2585
02:34:13,440 --> 02:34:17,910
mind you, he's pointing out one
vaccine is better than the other

2586
02:34:18,150 --> 02:34:23,430
against clinical disease and
almost 100% efficacy against

2587
02:34:23,430 --> 02:34:28,020
serious disease that has shown
to be clearly safe. That vaccine

2588
02:34:28,020 --> 02:34:33,780
was actually developed in the in
my Institute's vaccine research

2589
02:34:33,780 --> 02:34:40,980
center by a team of scientists,
led by Dr. Bonnie Graham and his

2590
02:34:40,980 --> 02:34:42,180
close colleague,

2591
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:46,080
Dr. Oz mechi, a Corbett or
Kizzy. Corbett

2592
02:34:46,260 --> 02:34:49,860
Kizzy is an African American
scientist, who is right at the

2593
02:34:49,860 --> 02:34:52,800
forefront of the development of
the vaccine

2594
02:34:52,830 --> 02:34:55,590
sounds more like she's the
lackey of some guy who really

2595
02:34:55,590 --> 02:34:56,820
did the vaccine, but Okay,

2596
02:34:56,850 --> 02:34:59,580
so the first thing you might
want to say to my African

2597
02:34:59,580 --> 02:35:03,900
American Brothers and sisters,
the vaccine in

2598
02:35:04,890 --> 02:35:07,800
an African American woman, and
that is just a fact.

2599
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:09,060
I mean, that is the fact

2600
02:35:09,060 --> 02:35:11,880
that I think that's some of the
things that people don't fully

2601
02:35:11,880 --> 02:35:12,660
appreciate.

2602
02:35:12,810 --> 02:35:18,150
So, you know, even evil doctors,
as long as they're black, you

2603
02:35:18,150 --> 02:35:24,810
can trust him. It's good to go.
And this moderna is made in

2604
02:35:24,810 --> 02:35:28,560
Fauci slab I heard him say it
No, no, that was developed in my

2605
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:34,470
lab and it said, and that's it.
So I wonder and I'd like to know

2606
02:35:34,740 --> 02:35:41,670
if what was her name the Dr.
Reza. Kizzy Kizzy and the is the

2607
02:35:41,670 --> 02:35:47,430
example that you gave Kizzy. Dr
Kizzy is she also cut in on the

2608
02:35:47,880 --> 02:35:51,750
patent? Is she on the patent or
the murder? no vaccine? I looked

2609
02:35:51,750 --> 02:35:56,430
I couldn't find it. So are you
shortchanging your black doctors

2610
02:35:56,430 --> 02:36:00,180
Dr. Fauci, that stuff that was
developed in your lab where

2611
02:36:00,180 --> 02:36:03,990
everyone including you is on the
patent is Kizzy on it? I didn't

2612
02:36:03,990 --> 02:36:06,900
see it might not be looking in
the right place. I'll be the

2613
02:36:06,900 --> 02:36:12,000
first to admit to these guys and
to say, so my black and my black

2614
02:36:12,120 --> 02:36:13,710
brothers and sisters one place

2615
02:36:13,710 --> 02:36:14,280
to look.

2616
02:36:14,490 --> 02:36:16,290
Yeah, the US Patent Trade
Office.

2617
02:36:16,890 --> 02:36:18,810
Yes. And that list is right at
the beginning.

2618
02:36:19,830 --> 02:36:24,210
So my black and brown brothers
and sisters, FSU Fauci, that's

2619
02:36:24,210 --> 02:36:30,570
so condescending. really lame.
So there you go. They think

2620
02:36:30,570 --> 02:36:32,520
that's going to work. Good luck.

2621
02:36:35,010 --> 02:36:38,880
Maybe, you know, it's doable to
get people to take the vaccine

2622
02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:44,760
if you don't do shit like that.
Yeah. Because then it gets

2623
02:36:44,760 --> 02:36:47,070
loose, a little suspicious. I
mean, if I was somebody who was

2624
02:36:47,070 --> 02:36:51,630
inclined to take the vaccine,
and I know people that are and I

2625
02:36:51,630 --> 02:36:56,130
was black, and I saw this, I
say, What is it? What is this

2626
02:36:56,130 --> 02:37:00,480
about? Why are they doing this?
This is suspicious. I think

2627
02:37:00,480 --> 02:37:03,780
twice about it. Very poor poor
execution.

2628
02:37:04,950 --> 02:37:09,150
It's it's what they always do
it. So it's also like, what was

2629
02:37:09,330 --> 02:37:11,010
Gil written? Yeah.

2630
02:37:12,570 --> 02:37:16,440
And I don't have a clip of it.
But it's the same thing I saw.

2631
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:21,990
Oh, where was this someone as a
as promised that Bo? I'm going

2632
02:37:21,990 --> 02:37:26,160
to put in a bill and it will be
for Reparations. We're going to

2633
02:37:26,160 --> 02:37:32,760
have a study group. Oh my gosh,
you must love our black brothers

2634
02:37:32,760 --> 02:37:37,470
and sisters because you giving
them a study. This has been done

2635
02:37:37,470 --> 02:37:44,460
1000 times. It's all I can see
is people really think African

2636
02:37:44,460 --> 02:37:48,480
Americans and people as they say
brown and black communities that

2637
02:37:48,480 --> 02:37:50,910
they're inferior. That's how
they talk. These are horrible

2638
02:37:50,910 --> 02:37:55,650
people. Yeah,

2639
02:37:55,830 --> 02:38:00,750
that's a summarize that's
probably exactly the genesis of

2640
02:38:00,750 --> 02:38:02,700
the whole thing. That Yeah.

2641
02:38:03,780 --> 02:38:07,200
What they're just actually
racist. They're racist and

2642
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:07,620
worse. They

2643
02:38:07,620 --> 02:38:11,520
are that same statement. That
phrase that Dutch phrase you'd

2644
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:12,630
love to say what you said

2645
02:38:12,660 --> 02:38:15,120
being yourself, would you cook
though the health does Yakuza?

2646
02:38:15,120 --> 02:38:15,420
Yeah.

2647
02:38:15,570 --> 02:38:19,290
Yeah. I'm trying to try to
memorize the phrase.

2648
02:38:19,320 --> 02:38:22,410
No, it's not. It's not very
difficult to do. I heard a new

2649
02:38:22,410 --> 02:38:26,310
one today, which I liked a lot.
metaphor brought it down to it

2650
02:38:26,310 --> 02:38:32,310
takes you back on fleeced, which
is roughly translates to a

2651
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:36,630
grilled dove flew right into
your mouth, which is a guest

2652
02:38:36,660 --> 02:38:37,800
drilled it has to be

2653
02:38:37,800 --> 02:38:38,730
grilled. Yes. Because

2654
02:38:38,730 --> 02:38:42,240
it's done. It's grilled. It
tastes good. It's it's the dove

2655
02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:44,760
has been cooked and it felt it
flew right into your mouth, the

2656
02:38:44,760 --> 02:38:45,570
grilled dove.

2657
02:38:46,170 --> 02:38:49,920
And what's what it was the
phrase imply that

2658
02:38:49,980 --> 02:38:52,740
you were looking for something
and you got exactly what you

2659
02:38:52,740 --> 02:38:56,580
wanted? It flew right in your
face. The grilled the grilled

2660
02:38:56,850 --> 02:39:00,720
dove. Man, the Dutch man they're
filled with stuff.

2661
02:39:01,290 --> 02:39:03,090
Where they get these little
phrases. They're

2662
02:39:03,240 --> 02:39:06,450
cute. Let me see these. Let me
just see them. rechecking this

2663
02:39:06,450 --> 02:39:09,360
patent. Are you sure it's the
one up front? Oh, here it is.

2664
02:39:09,360 --> 02:39:09,810
Yes.

2665
02:39:10,470 --> 02:39:13,290
Yeah, it would be at the
beginning now. Now there's no

2666
02:39:13,290 --> 02:39:16,110
kids in here unless it says at
all at the end.

2667
02:39:17,310 --> 02:39:20,580
Which wouldn't be no good. Oh,
they don't have an at all.

2668
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:22,980
No, they usually put everyone's
name there.

2669
02:39:22,980 --> 02:39:31,380
They have a Justin guild from
Massachusetts, Medina, Texas, of

2670
02:39:31,380 --> 02:39:35,700
course. That's the assignee, the
inventor Antonin de feu gatos,

2671
02:39:36,120 --> 02:39:41,190
from Waterloo. Oh, that's from
Belgium. I don't know exactly

2672
02:39:41,190 --> 02:39:45,330
how they how they do this is
Fauci even on the list. He's got

2673
02:39:45,330 --> 02:39:46,290
to be on the list.

2674
02:39:46,860 --> 02:39:51,030
Not necessarily be having a
piece of the action so far as

2675
02:39:51,030 --> 02:39:54,540
the stocks concerned doesn't
mean you got to be on any lists.

2676
02:39:54,630 --> 02:39:57,810
You're already on a real on the
important list. No, this is

2677
02:39:57,810 --> 02:39:58,260
true.

2678
02:40:00,480 --> 02:40:04,500
But for sure Kizzy is not on the
list. But you found she always

2679
02:40:04,500 --> 02:40:08,400
gets a piece of this. So I don't
know if if that goes to the NIH,

2680
02:40:08,460 --> 02:40:10,680
the disclosure documents are
there. They're in the show

2681
02:40:10,680 --> 02:40:12,900
notes. You can take a look at
it. I was just looking to see if

2682
02:40:12,900 --> 02:40:19,020
I could see anyone else. Nope.
Anyway, so it's common and what

2683
02:40:19,020 --> 02:40:22,530
can we look for now I say in the
next day or two, we will have

2684
02:40:22,530 --> 02:40:26,970
the typical shots of lines
around the block. All the

2685
02:40:26,970 --> 02:40:30,900
videos, huge lines are lined up
and ready to go.

2686
02:40:31,710 --> 02:40:35,040
And if and half the lines will
be some of the technicians doing

2687
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:38,370
the shot because the lines will
never be long enough till I make

2688
02:40:38,370 --> 02:40:42,150
a million mile long line to show
that to the public over and over

2689
02:40:42,150 --> 02:40:45,420
and over again. So you see, oh,
there are people, I don't

2690
02:40:45,420 --> 02:40:48,420
understand their mentality, but
they see a line they get in it.

2691
02:40:49,199 --> 02:40:50,249
And, and I've been

2692
02:40:50,250 --> 02:40:53,130
thinking this must be a good
night club. There's a line out

2693
02:40:53,130 --> 02:40:53,700
front.

2694
02:40:54,840 --> 02:40:58,830
I've been thinking Yes, the
velvet rope concept. But a

2695
02:40:58,830 --> 02:41:01,770
Walmart is going to be one of
the big distributors for this.

2696
02:41:02,490 --> 02:41:06,540
And to me that adds a little
interesting twist to our holiday

2697
02:41:06,540 --> 02:41:09,960
favorite item which we kicked
off on Thursday, we had the

2698
02:41:09,960 --> 02:41:14,490
first secret santa paying for
everyone's layaway at Walmart.

2699
02:41:14,910 --> 02:41:15,720
And I've just

2700
02:41:15,750 --> 02:41:18,000
always well Monday ever do it
anywhere else.

2701
02:41:18,300 --> 02:41:21,720
Well, I'm just thinking it might
be an extra draw for people to

2702
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:25,350
come to Walmart. And you know,
once you got them in the door

2703
02:41:25,350 --> 02:41:28,590
they'll have their greeters and
telling them hey, hey bro, hey,

2704
02:41:28,590 --> 02:41:31,140
black brothers and sisters. You
should come over here will give

2705
02:41:31,140 --> 02:41:37,320
you that shot. And right on cue,
the second secret santa at

2706
02:41:37,320 --> 02:41:37,890
Walmart

2707
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:41,790
11 tonight shoppers at a tri
cities Walmart got a big

2708
02:41:41,790 --> 02:41:43,020
surprise this week.

2709
02:41:43,110 --> 02:41:48,090
And almost $70,000 layaway
balance paid in full and just in

2710
02:41:48,090 --> 02:41:49,140
time for Christmas.

2711
02:41:51,180 --> 02:41:52,740
I'm still in shock Actually, I

2712
02:41:52,740 --> 02:41:54,510
really I couldn't believe it.
And I still can't

2713
02:41:54,540 --> 02:41:57,660
shoppers who put their Christmas
gifts on layaway at Walmart in

2714
02:41:57,660 --> 02:42:00,300
Bristol, Tennessee couldn't
believe the news. I got a

2715
02:42:00,300 --> 02:42:02,130
notification on my email

2716
02:42:02,490 --> 02:42:04,110
that my

2717
02:42:04,410 --> 02:42:07,170
layaway had been paid for and I
thought well that's kind of

2718
02:42:07,170 --> 02:42:11,370
weird. On Monday someone walked
into the store not to shop but

2719
02:42:11,370 --> 02:42:14,910
to pay off all the layaway
balances the total for

2720
02:42:14,910 --> 02:42:19,770
everything $64,995.51

2721
02:42:19,800 --> 02:42:23,760
she said yes somebody came in
this morning at six o'clock and

2722
02:42:23,880 --> 02:42:24,540
paid everybody's

2723
02:42:24,540 --> 02:42:28,110
layaway. But he wants me to tell
you that he loves you.

2724
02:42:28,380 --> 02:42:31,620
God bless you. And Merry
Christmas. Those whose bills

2725
02:42:31,620 --> 02:42:34,890
were paid may never know who
gave them a Christmas blessing.

2726
02:42:35,160 --> 02:42:39,150
But they say they will always be
grateful this man this man made

2727
02:42:39,300 --> 02:42:40,800
my son hate he says he

2728
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:43,980
loves you too. But we love

2729
02:42:44,700 --> 02:42:48,300
No clue who gave the gift we are
told according to Walmart The

2730
02:42:48,300 --> 02:42:52,260
deadline to pay off your layaway
balance is December 14. Sara

2731
02:42:52,260 --> 02:42:55,110
still little time for others
maybe who you know are getting

2732
02:42:55,110 --> 02:42:57,090
the idea tonight to go out and
do the say

2733
02:42:57,300 --> 02:43:00,990
what a great way to pay it
forward a great gifts during

2734
02:43:00,990 --> 02:43:02,160
this holiday season.

2735
02:43:02,250 --> 02:43:05,280
What a great way to pay it
forward. Yes, come

2736
02:43:05,280 --> 02:43:09,570
on things. Yeah. First of all,
how'd they get ahold of that guy

2737
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:12,780
got the email says it was paid
off. And did they get him on?

2738
02:43:13,290 --> 02:43:15,900
interviewing? Just going on
here?

2739
02:43:15,930 --> 02:43:20,160
No, no. I just want to give you
the facts. The the guy who paid

2740
02:43:20,160 --> 02:43:24,750
him off less that no, you heard
a guy who got his balance taken

2741
02:43:24,750 --> 02:43:27,990
care of he received an email
from Walmart saying that his

2742
02:43:27,990 --> 02:43:29,430
balance had been paid. Yes.

2743
02:43:29,610 --> 02:43:30,990
Well, how do they get ahold of
him?

2744
02:43:31,380 --> 02:43:35,280
They because he because he has a
balance at Walmart.

2745
02:43:36,150 --> 02:43:38,640
What is the media say? Hey, give
me all your give me a list

2746
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:42,330
everyone that balance at Walmart
which no stores going to do

2747
02:43:42,360 --> 02:43:43,620
Walmart does.

2748
02:43:44,910 --> 02:43:45,720
Hello. So

2749
02:43:45,720 --> 02:43:46,410
the second thing

2750
02:43:46,590 --> 02:43:48,120
is ad buy. Hello.

2751
02:43:48,150 --> 02:43:52,110
Did you know The ad buyer the ad
buy? You got $64,000 This is a

2752
02:43:52,110 --> 02:43:55,860
multiple ad buy. This was a you
have to see what the what the

2753
02:43:55,860 --> 02:44:01,020
price was, let's say the local
five stations to do an ad buy

2754
02:44:01,050 --> 02:44:07,080
each one of them is the amount
of $64,000. And I still wonder

2755
02:44:07,080 --> 02:44:10,650
to this day whether this is a
native ad, or are the stations

2756
02:44:10,650 --> 02:44:12,960
just suckered into running this
story?

2757
02:44:13,560 --> 02:44:19,080
Yes, it would be my I think yes,
it's both of them. It's probably

2758
02:44:19,080 --> 02:44:23,490
a hell of a lot cheaper to do
the 64,000 $4,000

2759
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:27,360
spread out over maybe 1020
stations in the whole state.

2760
02:44:27,570 --> 02:44:29,730
Because it's such a feel good
story.

2761
02:44:29,789 --> 02:44:33,509
They got no agenda show to run
the guy on the no agenda show.

2762
02:44:34,379 --> 02:44:35,759
Got on the no agenda show.
There's

2763
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:38,550
another good example of some
free advertising for Walmart.

2764
02:44:38,580 --> 02:44:42,090
Yeah, although we do in a
condemnation sort of way sort

2765
02:44:42,090 --> 02:44:45,600
of. Still, you know, no
publicity is bad publicity.

2766
02:44:47,190 --> 02:44:51,570
Yeah, hey, here's an idea of
Walmart. Why don't you? Why

2767
02:44:51,570 --> 02:44:54,270
don't you spend some of that
over here with us. We'll talk

2768
02:44:54,270 --> 02:44:56,040

02:44:56,040 --> 02:44:58,080
cash. Yeah. I'm gonna show

2770
02:44:59,880 --> 02:45:03,150
you Imagine all the people who
could do. Oh yeah, that'd be

2771
02:45:03,150 --> 02:45:03,510
fine.

2772
02:45:11,070 --> 02:45:14,370

support, and these donations are

2857
02:51:19,530 --> 02:51:23,790
incredibly valuable to us. They
quite literally keep the show

2858
02:51:23,790 --> 02:51:28,290
going. I also know a lot of
people because of 1212. When you

2859
02:51:28,290 --> 02:51:31,830
sent the email decided to up
there are 1111 donations to

2860
02:51:31,830 --> 02:51:36,180
1212. We don't mention those
under $50. Primarily because

2861
02:51:36,180 --> 02:51:39,600
people want to remain anonymous,
at some guaranteed level. So

2862
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:41,760
anything under 50 is never
mentioned, which is why we do

2863
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:45,600
have people showing up with
4999, etc. But we understand,

2864
02:51:45,870 --> 02:51:48,810
and we appreciate it and we'd
love for you to consider

2865
02:51:49,110 --> 02:51:51,990
donating your time your talent
or your treasure for the next

2866
02:51:51,990 --> 02:51:56,640
show. That'll be 1304 episodes
of this grand experiment. Where

2867
02:51:56,670 --> 02:51:59,010
really you are the producer,
you're not a listener, you're

2868
02:51:59,010 --> 02:52:02,160
not our fans, you're not our
audience. You are the producer

2869
02:52:02,160 --> 02:52:04,950
of the best podcast in the
universe, an experiment that

2870
02:52:04,950 --> 02:52:10,020
shall continue for the
foreseeable future.org slash and

2871
02:52:10,470 --> 02:52:12,600
no karma is for everybody who
needs

2872
02:52:12,600 --> 02:52:16,560
jobs, jobs, jobs and jobs.

2873
02:52:21,360 --> 02:52:21,870
karma.

2874

And quite a list we have I think

Ooh, baby. That was a long one.
No nights though. No title

2897
02:53:58,140 --> 02:54:01,470
changes but we do have an
overview of the meetups.

2898
02:54:08,190 --> 02:54:12,270
Before we give you the full
rundown here is a meetup report

2899
02:54:12,270 --> 02:54:15,270
the no agenda meetups are
actually protests you know if

2900
02:54:15,270 --> 02:54:19,560
there's any kind of hassle with
the local Popo, just talk to him

2901
02:54:19,560 --> 02:54:22,590
like you went to a protest. I
went to no agenda protest calm

2902
02:54:22,590 --> 02:54:25,920
it was organized man. Okay,
you're good to go. And you might

2903
02:54:25,920 --> 02:54:30,120
find yourself at the NA local
512 meetup where Black Knights

2904
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:33,300

2910
02:54:50,130 --> 02:54:50,790
themselves.

2911
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:51,390

really need and don't know that
you're privileged really are

2957
02:57:26,970 --> 02:57:31,260
privileged in these days not
many people get to find people

2958
02:57:31,260 --> 02:57:34,710
that can just hang out with and
just chat with and not be

2959
02:57:34,710 --> 02:57:38,250
worried about stuff. So go take
your privilege to no agenda

2960
02:57:38,250 --> 02:57:42,960
meetups.com and if there isn't
one near you that you can attend

2961
02:57:42,960 --> 02:57:45,780
well, by golly, why don't you
start one yourself? No agenda

2962
02:57:45,780 --> 02:57:46,770
meetups.com

2963
02:58:06,240 --> 02:58:07,350
Yeah, baby.

2964
02:58:12,570 --> 02:58:13,920
I got a Brexit update.

2965
02:58:15,810 --> 02:58:17,220
Oh, good, cuz I don't have one.

2966
02:58:17,250 --> 02:58:23,700
Yeah. So they went into overtime
in the negotiations, and they

2967
02:58:23,700 --> 02:58:28,170
know they're not going to make
it. And so they are going to

2968
02:58:28,170 --> 02:58:32,280
push even a little bit further.
The President of the European

2969
02:58:32,280 --> 02:58:36,870
Union's Ursula Thunder Lion came
out and she looked a bit demure.

2970
02:58:37,980 --> 02:58:41,880
But she feels like at least
we're trying and remember, any

2971
02:58:41,880 --> 02:58:47,640
one of the 27 euro states can
veto this deal. So it's highly

2972
02:58:47,640 --> 02:58:53,190
unlikely considering it's about
fish. That's the final dispute.

2973
02:58:53,430 --> 02:58:54,300
It's about who

2974
02:58:55,110 --> 02:58:57,750
now that he vetoed, the Brits

2975
02:58:57,750 --> 02:59:01,500
already have their warships out
to protect their water fish.

2976
02:59:01,529 --> 02:59:04,529
Yeah, it's gonna block the
people fishing.

2977
02:59:04,560 --> 02:59:07,350
Yes, they're going to block
people from fishing. Here's the

2978
02:59:07,380 --> 02:59:07,890
Ursula

2979
02:59:07,920 --> 02:59:13,110
despite the exhaustion after
almost one year of negotiations,

2980
02:59:13,710 --> 02:59:17,130
and despite the fact that
deadlines have been missed over

2981
02:59:17,130 --> 02:59:22,770
and over. We both think that it
is responsible at this point in

2982
02:59:22,770 --> 02:59:28,650
time to go the extra mile. We
have accordingly mandated our

2983
02:59:28,650 --> 02:59:32,640
negotiators to continue the
talks and to see whether or not

2984
02:59:32,640 --> 02:59:36,870
reach an agreement can be
reached. Even at this late

2985
02:59:36,900 --> 02:59:41,460
stage. The negotiations continue
here in Brussels.

2986
02:59:42,210 --> 02:59:45,990
Well, no one's no one thinks
it's likely they'll come up with

2987
02:59:45,990 --> 02:59:50,160
any kind of deal which would
mean a crash out no deal Brexit

2988
02:59:50,160 --> 02:59:51,000
here's Bo Joe

2989
02:59:51,030 --> 02:59:54,540
we're gonna continue to try. I'm
gonna try with all our hearts

2990
02:59:54,540 --> 02:59:58,800
and we'll be as creative as we
possibly can. You know, we we

2991
02:59:58,800 --> 03:00:02,430
remain willing to talk will
continue to do so. But in the

2992
03:00:02,430 --> 03:00:05,910
meantime, let's get ready for
the WTO option. And that's what

2993
03:00:05,910 --> 03:00:06,630
I told the cabinet

2994
03:00:06,930 --> 03:00:12,390
WTO. Babe. That's it going World
Trade Organization going

2995
03:00:12,390 --> 03:00:18,060
outside, then you know what? I
guarantee you British residents

2996
03:00:18,060 --> 03:00:21,420
will not be allowed into the
European Union until the COVID

2997
03:00:21,420 --> 03:00:25,260
is over. There'll be they'll be
shunned. Because, you know,

2998
03:00:25,260 --> 03:00:28,170
there's going to be a lot of bad
blood.

2999
03:00:30,690 --> 03:00:31,350
I think so I

3000
03:00:31,350 --> 03:00:33,150
think they're really going to be
mean.

3001
03:00:34,560 --> 03:00:35,670
For the EU, you mean?

3002
03:00:35,699 --> 03:00:37,829
Yeah. The EU is going to be
mean, they're gonna be like, No,

3003
03:00:37,829 --> 03:00:37,889
I

3004
03:00:37,890 --> 03:00:39,960
think they're gonna be mean.
Yeah, I agree. Because this is

3005
03:00:39,960 --> 03:00:42,990
like a humiliation of the
highest order, kind of,

3006
03:00:43,590 --> 03:00:47,400
you know, It's humiliating. I'll
tell you what's humiliating. I

3007
03:00:47,400 --> 03:00:53,010
told you, we went out Saturday
night, downtown. And I was

3008
03:00:53,010 --> 03:00:57,540
excited, because I'd been
downtown with the dinner on

3009
03:00:57,540 --> 03:01:00,660
Tuesday. And I said, Tina, you
know, love it, and it's

3010
03:01:00,660 --> 03:01:03,330
beautiful. It's all Christmassy,
and everyone's all jacked up

3011
03:01:03,330 --> 03:01:06,150
about it. And as we're driving
across the first three bridge,

3012
03:01:06,570 --> 03:01:11,880
there's City Hall is green. City
Hall is illuminated in green.

3013
03:01:11,910 --> 03:01:14,910
And I think that there is that
what they're doing for

3014
03:01:14,910 --> 03:01:18,180
Christmas. Is that this thing?
Well, no,

3015
03:01:18,270 --> 03:01:21,810
Austin City Hall is all lit up
tonight to commemorate the fifth

3016
03:01:21,840 --> 03:01:24,720
year of the Paris Climate
Agreement. It's an agreement

3017
03:01:25,110 --> 03:01:29,370
within 100 countries to achieve
net zero carbon emissions by the

3018
03:01:29,370 --> 03:01:32,070
middle of the century. And
President Donald Trump pulled

3019
03:01:32,070 --> 03:01:34,890
the us out of that agreement.
But leaders with the City of

3020
03:01:34,890 --> 03:01:38,550
Austin say they're still working
to reduce carbon emissions.

3021
03:01:38,910 --> 03:01:41,340
So the verse you signal with the
green light

3022
03:01:42,420 --> 03:01:46,230
brother gets a class Hey, we

3023
03:01:46,230 --> 03:01:47,310
don't even do that. What

3024
03:01:47,310 --> 03:01:48,210
are we gonna do?

3025
03:01:49,050 --> 03:01:50,340
some green light man

3026
03:01:50,369 --> 03:01:52,859
that'll do a green lights in
California

3027
03:01:52,890 --> 03:01:53,670
green light.

3028
03:01:55,920 --> 03:01:57,060
douchebags.

3029
03:01:58,230 --> 03:02:01,470
greenies. Get out of here. I got
it really democratic Texas.

3030
03:02:01,500 --> 03:02:03,930
I got a depressing clip as long
as you have something to go out

3031
03:02:03,930 --> 03:02:04,740
on a high note I

3032
03:02:04,740 --> 03:02:07,620
do have one I have the Hitler a
Supercuts.

3033
03:02:07,710 --> 03:02:12,030
Oh, that can't be depressing.
Let's play that first. That's

3034
03:02:12,030 --> 03:02:13,170
gonna be great

3035
03:02:13,230 --> 03:02:14,880
this week, so not Trump.

3036
03:02:15,090 --> 03:02:18,630
ago, Kristallnacht happened, it
was the Nazis warning shot

3037
03:02:18,630 --> 03:02:22,200
across the bow of our human
civilization. After four years

3038
03:02:22,200 --> 03:02:25,440
of a modern day assault on those
same values by Donald Trump. I'm

3039
03:02:25,440 --> 03:02:25,560
gonna

3040
03:02:25,560 --> 03:02:29,670
use an extreme example. Think
about Hitler, so many stunning

3041
03:02:29,910 --> 03:02:30,810
parallels

3042
03:02:30,840 --> 03:02:33,060
to what Hitler was doing
describing

3043
03:02:33,060 --> 03:02:36,240
Hitler's psychological profile
and this only pertains to Adolf

3044
03:02:36,240 --> 03:02:40,020
Hitler. There is so much that
has resonance of the Third Reich

3045
03:02:40,050 --> 03:02:41,490
in this administration, many

3046
03:02:41,520 --> 03:02:43,020
tendencies like Adolf Hitler,

3047
03:02:43,020 --> 03:02:47,490
does this look like Germany in
1932 we're getting close and

3048
03:02:47,490 --> 03:02:50,100
this only pertains to Adolf
Hitler and pertains to nobody

3049
03:02:50,100 --> 03:02:50,400
else

3050
03:02:50,430 --> 03:02:54,450
90% of what he says I'm like,
this guy gets it if you read

3051
03:02:54,450 --> 03:02:57,750
anything about the rise of Third
Reich and Adolf Hitler, you will

3052
03:02:57,750 --> 03:02:58,770
see the parallels

3053
03:02:59,370 --> 03:03:00,720
is a true psychopath

3054
03:03:01,980 --> 03:03:04,650
solid that sounds a lot like a
certain leader that killed

3055
03:03:04,680 --> 03:03:05,760
members of my family.

3056
03:03:06,630 --> 03:03:11,790
Wow Jews of how Hitler came to
power he came to power under

3057
03:03:11,850 --> 03:03:15,240
fair free elections talking
about Adolf Hitler and that's

3058
03:03:15,240 --> 03:03:16,290
all we're talking about.

3059
03:03:20,130 --> 03:03:21,660
Donald loves Nazis.

3060
03:03:23,070 --> 03:03:24,510
CNN say that

3061
03:03:26,490 --> 03:03:28,050
he came with it Wow.

3062
03:03:29,580 --> 03:03:35,220
We always knew it wasn't Did you
hit upon a a super cut database

3063
03:03:35,220 --> 03:03:36,960
or something? So I'm super,

3064
03:03:37,620 --> 03:03:39,150
super gut roll.

3065
03:03:39,240 --> 03:03:44,370
You You just landed in some
beautiful pile of supercut This

3066
03:03:44,370 --> 03:03:51,510
is a very distressing clip from
CBS The show is called who's the

3067
03:03:51,510 --> 03:03:56,370
neighborhood? Yes the
neighborhood and as you know in

3068
03:03:56,370 --> 03:03:59,010
most of these big Hollywood
productions we have the Norman

3069
03:03:59,010 --> 03:03:59,310
Lear

3070
03:03:59,730 --> 03:04:02,190
let me I know that show very
well. I'm gonna explain the

3071
03:04:02,190 --> 03:04:02,670
premise

3072
03:04:02,699 --> 03:04:03,329
Oh, thank you.

3073
03:04:05,430 --> 03:04:12,900
A white kind of a liberal white
guy young white guy millennial

3074
03:04:12,930 --> 03:04:15,900
older millennial moves in with
his wife into the middle of a

3075
03:04:15,900 --> 03:04:21,750
black neighborhood, bro. Okay.
And he and his black neighbor is

3076
03:04:21,750 --> 03:04:26,730
a jerk. And he and the white
guys just this naive guy loves

3077
03:04:26,730 --> 03:04:30,240
everything because he's a lover
not a not a fighter. And he's

3078
03:04:30,240 --> 03:04:33,390
just the most optimistic guy and
he sees everything great and he

3079
03:04:33,390 --> 03:04:35,940
thinks is fantastic. deliver
this black neighborhood because

3080
03:04:35,940 --> 03:04:39,210
it shows what what you know as
great white liberals are really

3081
03:04:39,210 --> 03:04:42,630
like, and it's and comedy
ensues. It's a comedy.

3082
03:04:42,660 --> 03:04:47,460
Yes. Well, here comes a great
comedic bit. Now this is here's

3083
03:04:47,460 --> 03:04:51,270
the scene. I guess they have a
kid. At least one younger kid.

3084
03:04:51,660 --> 03:04:56,730
And this kid's friend who lives
in the neighborhood. And this

3085
03:04:56,760 --> 03:04:59,250
into the kid is white with the
white family. His friend is

3086
03:04:59,250 --> 03:05:02,970
black. He was arrested by the
police or harassed by the

3087
03:05:02,970 --> 03:05:07,170
police. So the white mom has to
sit down with the white kid and

3088
03:05:07,170 --> 03:05:08,610
have a talk.

3089
03:05:08,790 --> 03:05:14,370
organised one after. You know.
She got beat up by the Popo.

3090
03:05:21,990 --> 03:05:25,860
Hey, I know there's a lot going
on right now. You want to talk

3091
03:05:25,860 --> 03:05:30,360
about it? I understand where the
police beat up. Trey. Did you do

3092
03:05:30,360 --> 03:05:35,070
something wrong? No. The police
are the ones who did something

3093
03:05:35,070 --> 03:05:42,780
wrong. Supposed to be the good
guys. Yeah. But there's some bad

3094
03:05:42,780 --> 03:05:49,680
ones too. So if there's ever an
emergency, should I still call

3095
03:05:49,680 --> 03:05:54,330
them? Oh, yeah. First, sweetie,
they would never hurt you.

3096
03:05:54,960 --> 03:06:00,150
Right? Because I'm a kid.
Actually, it's because you're

3097
03:06:00,150 --> 03:06:04,950
white. You see the police in
this country have a history of

3098
03:06:04,950 --> 03:06:09,120
treating us better than they
treat black people. But that

3099
03:06:09,120 --> 03:06:12,510
doesn't make any sense. Why
would they do that? That's a

3100
03:06:12,510 --> 03:06:18,360
good question. The answer is
kind of complicated. Oh, that's

3101
03:06:18,360 --> 03:06:22,020
what you said when asked for
babies come from I find

3102
03:06:22,020 --> 03:06:24,120
this so despicable

3103
03:06:26,610 --> 03:06:33,330
Yes, it's it is a it's
despicable is even the right

3104
03:06:33,330 --> 03:06:34,080
word for it.

3105
03:06:34,199 --> 03:06:37,649
And basically just threw all
police all across the country

3106
03:06:37,679 --> 03:06:40,259
under the bus like oh, yeah,
it's just because you're white.

3107
03:06:40,259 --> 03:06:43,199
You know, I was like we got a
history of that isn't how it is.

3108
03:06:44,159 --> 03:06:47,309
This is Norman Lear Hollywood
foundation. Crap, man. That's

3109
03:06:47,309 --> 03:06:52,139
what this is. shoved right into
the to the narrative. Oh, you

3110
03:06:52,139 --> 03:06:53,639
know, that was nice. No, I

3111
03:06:53,640 --> 03:06:57,690
disagree. I really just was. I
don't think it was necessary.

3112
03:06:57,930 --> 03:07:00,660
You don't have to go to Norman
Lear to pull that stuff out of

3113
03:07:00,660 --> 03:07:00,960
it. Yeah,

3114
03:07:00,960 --> 03:07:02,790
I agree. I agree. That's true.

3115
03:07:02,910 --> 03:07:06,480
This is just a Hollywood crap a
bunch of virtue signaling

3116
03:07:06,480 --> 03:07:09,840
douchebags, but decided to do
this. And they've been there was

3117
03:07:09,840 --> 03:07:12,690
the regular staff. I'm sure
there was no input from anybody

3118
03:07:12,690 --> 03:07:15,090
outside effect. I think if there
was, they would have had them

3119
03:07:15,090 --> 03:07:16,170
back off a little bit.

3120
03:07:16,529 --> 03:07:18,239
Yeah, cuz it was a bit too much.

3121
03:07:19,050 --> 03:07:19,710
I agree.

3122
03:07:21,630 --> 03:07:23,940
All right. Now I need something
happy because I'm depressed

3123
03:07:23,940 --> 03:07:24,660
about this.

3124
03:07:24,869 --> 03:07:28,139
No. Oh, well, I got a three
parter here. If you want to hear

3125
03:07:28,139 --> 03:07:29,489
about gay Christmas.

3126
03:07:29,609 --> 03:07:35,489
Oh, yes. Let's roll. Yes, I do.
Correct. I do want and, and just

3127
03:07:35,489 --> 03:07:39,599
so you know, don't say to me
later. We were too long.

3128
03:07:41,520 --> 03:07:43,800
Well, you're the one asked for
the additional material. I'm

3129
03:07:43,800 --> 03:07:46,260
gonna say we're too long because
we were too long. But don't you

3130
03:07:46,260 --> 03:07:50,310
have a single clip? No, this is
three clips. Okay, three parter.

3131
03:07:50,310 --> 03:07:53,640
I mean, you can just play part
one I think would be good. But I

3132
03:07:53,640 --> 03:07:56,640
also have a Rand Paul rant and
then Cheney, which has been

3133
03:07:56,880 --> 03:07:57,210
around

3134
03:07:57,240 --> 03:07:59,340
No, no, no, I want gay
Christmas.

3135
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:04,770
I bet you do. Okay, so let's
play now. This is from the CBC.

3136
03:08:04,770 --> 03:08:09,510
And this is from the reporter,
they, the guy who's the reporter

3137
03:08:09,510 --> 03:08:12,960
seems gay to me, but I don't
what do I know? And he also said

3138
03:08:12,990 --> 03:08:17,910
he separates the gays from his
group, which is us. But But

3139
03:08:17,910 --> 03:08:21,180
apparently, I said, apparently,
I said it. I heard it, I

3140
03:08:21,180 --> 03:08:23,820
caught it. Us versus the gays. I
hear. Okay,

3141
03:08:23,880 --> 03:08:30,000
us versus the gays. And what is
going on is that Hollywood's

3142
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:34,740
decided to make Christmas gay.
So they rolled out a bunch of

3143
03:08:34,740 --> 03:08:37,830
gay movies and everything, all
these Christmas movies that are

3144
03:08:37,830 --> 03:08:41,340
Oh, I start starting with the
one movie with Kristen Stewart

3145
03:08:41,340 --> 03:08:43,470
and they call Happy holidays or
something. I can't remember the

3146
03:08:43,470 --> 03:08:43,710
name.

3147
03:08:43,740 --> 03:08:46,890
I didn't get the memo about the
Christmas being gay this year.

3148
03:08:47,340 --> 03:08:51,210
Well get a clue. This CBC
Canadian broadcast

3149
03:08:51,270 --> 03:08:56,550
a whole new crop of Christmas
movies, LGBTQ films, released

3150
03:08:56,550 --> 03:09:00,840
for this holiday season, part of
a trend that caught Eli's eye.

3151
03:09:00,870 --> 03:09:04,650
So he's back with us from his
home, getting set for his

3152
03:09:04,650 --> 03:09:08,640
holidays and looking to these
holiday offerings. As I said,

3153
03:09:08,760 --> 03:09:12,480
it's a whole new landscape, Eli?
Yeah,

3154
03:09:12,480 --> 03:09:14,790
I mean, you know, it's
interesting. So happiest season

3155
03:09:14,790 --> 03:09:17,850
really kind of kicked off this
discussion. You know, there was

3156
03:09:17,850 --> 03:09:21,450
a time a few weeks ago, I
couldn't open Twitter without

3157
03:09:21,450 --> 03:09:26,460
being just like enveloped in a
discussion about who Kristen

3158
03:09:26,460 --> 03:09:29,250
Stewart's should character
should have ended up with how

3159
03:09:29,250 --> 03:09:33,540
did Harper behaving people had
so many feelings about this

3160
03:09:33,540 --> 03:09:36,720
film, and it seemed to really
strike a chord in audience, you

3161
03:09:36,720 --> 03:09:41,280
know, certainly wider than just
LGBTQ. And so this which was

3162
03:09:41,280 --> 03:09:44,610
originally released on Hulu and
streaming in Canada, turned out

3163
03:09:44,610 --> 03:09:48,300
to be quite the success and
also, I think part of this new

3164
03:09:48,300 --> 03:09:52,770
wave of content that we're
noticing in the traditionally

3165
03:09:52,800 --> 03:09:58,170
very traditional holiday genre
and so other films that are

3166
03:09:58,230 --> 03:10:02,070
popping up under the mistletoe
This year Christmas house from

3167
03:10:02,070 --> 03:10:05,160
the Hallmark Channel featuring a
gay chant a gay couple. It's a

3168
03:10:05,160 --> 03:10:10,620
very big change for the channel.
There's dashing in December

3169
03:10:11,100 --> 03:10:15,660
Paramount network, there's the
Christmas setup on the lifetime

3170
03:10:15,660 --> 03:10:18,960
network. Now I reached out to
Christian Baker in Nashville.

3171
03:10:19,020 --> 03:10:22,500
She's the producer and director
of a couple of holiday films

3172
03:10:22,620 --> 03:10:26,040
made for queer viewers. Last
year, they made a movie called

3173
03:10:26,040 --> 03:10:28,770
season of love, which got a
great response for their

3174
03:10:28,770 --> 03:10:31,350
audience. She was getting a lot
of her customers saying, you

3175
03:10:31,350 --> 03:10:35,100
know, we want to see our own
selves in these Christmas films.

3176
03:10:35,190 --> 03:10:38,760
This year. They're releasing, I
hate New Year's but a lesbian

3177
03:10:38,760 --> 03:10:43,050
couple in Nashville. And what
she was telling me is a part of

3178
03:10:43,050 --> 03:10:47,880
the need is that we have had a
lot of great, powerful dramatic

3179
03:10:47,880 --> 03:10:52,200
movies with gay and lesbian
storylines, but they are quite

3180
03:10:52,260 --> 03:10:55,890
serious and there was something
that was missing for her

3181
03:10:55,890 --> 03:10:58,110
audience. You know, I

3182
03:10:58,110 --> 03:11:01,230
can almost see the Hallmark
Channel commercial.

3183
03:11:02,190 --> 03:11:04,110
This year celebrate in

3184
03:11:04,110 --> 03:11:10,590
style with a Hallmark Channel.
We've got twinks in my tree. We

3185
03:11:10,590 --> 03:11:12,990
have Are you sure this is
eggnog?

3186
03:11:14,820 --> 03:11:15,930
This is great.

3187
03:11:18,450 --> 03:11:21,540
Let's listen to what this
producer has to say this clip to

3188
03:11:21,660 --> 03:11:22,050
their

3189
03:11:22,080 --> 03:11:25,980
unrequited love their, you know,
like, I can't be with you

3190
03:11:25,980 --> 03:11:29,190
because society tells me that or
I'm coming out but my Mormon

3191
03:11:29,190 --> 03:11:30,570
parents are gonna hate me.

3192
03:11:30,570 --> 03:11:33,060
And, you know, it's it's all of
that

3193
03:11:33,060 --> 03:11:36,510
that's that we absolutely
experience and some people still

3194
03:11:36,510 --> 03:11:39,630
experienced that. But I think
what was also missing was sort

3195
03:11:39,630 --> 03:11:44,040
of this classic trophy,
fabulous, happy love story.

3196
03:11:44,220 --> 03:11:49,200
Everybody wants their serving of
holiday mush. Bees movies are

3197
03:11:49,200 --> 03:11:54,360
comfort food, and why shouldn't
gay and lesbian audiences be

3198
03:11:54,360 --> 03:11:58,830
able to enjoy that, like the
rest of us? That was really what

3199
03:11:58,830 --> 03:12:01,800
she said is we want our happy
endings. You know, we want our

3200
03:12:01,800 --> 03:12:05,880
fun, cheesy stuff. No one is
saying that this is Hamlet. But

3201
03:12:05,880 --> 03:12:08,160
they certainly want to see
themselves represented in the

3202
03:12:08,160 --> 03:12:09,900
genre along with everyone else.

3203
03:12:10,500 --> 03:12:14,790
So is that, you know, that
desire to see that Hollywood,

3204
03:12:14,790 --> 03:12:19,230
that Hallmark moment? Is that
really the explanation? Why why

3205
03:12:19,230 --> 03:12:22,020
the change and the broader
industry change a lie?

3206
03:12:22,230 --> 03:12:25,590
I mean, from the from the
audience? Yes. But from the

3207
03:12:25,620 --> 03:12:29,310
industry. I think actually,
interestingly, it's a business

3208
03:12:29,310 --> 03:12:34,410
case and a convincing one. So I
talked to glad CEO and President

3209
03:12:34,410 --> 03:12:37,680
Sarah Kate Ellis, this is the
gay and lesbian advocacy group.

3210
03:12:37,680 --> 03:12:42,210
And what she has noticed is a
real big ship. You look at the

3211
03:12:42,210 --> 03:12:45,060
demographics in America, for
example, I think if you look at

3212
03:12:45,060 --> 03:12:49,710
like 18 to 34, you're seeing as
much of the population as 30%,

3213
03:12:49,740 --> 03:12:54,570
identifying as LGBTQ in one way
or another Wow, look at

3214
03:12:54,570 --> 03:12:58,590
representation on television,
it's changing. But in terms of

3215
03:12:58,590 --> 03:13:02,190
characters on screen, it's still
in single digits. But what Alice

3216
03:13:02,190 --> 03:13:05,940
was telling me is what really
has changed for the creators and

3217
03:13:05,940 --> 03:13:10,290
the producers and the executives
is a shift in that business

3218
03:13:10,290 --> 03:13:13,200
model. And what now makes sense.
Take a look.

3219
03:13:13,410 --> 03:13:17,130
She's saying 30% of the audience
is gay is that what he said?

3220
03:13:18,030 --> 03:13:21,390
in the in the younger debt in
the millennial demographic,

3221
03:13:21,960 --> 03:13:25,770
you know that Tina and I we saw
the trailer for that movie with

3222
03:13:25,770 --> 03:13:32,160
the the two girls as he said,
oh, let's be in love. But it

3223
03:13:32,160 --> 03:13:37,020
wasn't a good movie. It wasn't a
it was about her coming out or

3224
03:13:37,020 --> 03:13:42,270
not. It wasn't a you know, you
Christmas miracle type movie and

3225
03:13:42,270 --> 03:13:46,200
every there's multiple
storylines of love. And it just

3226
03:13:46,200 --> 03:13:49,650
wasn't that it was all about
coming out very stressful. I

3227
03:13:49,650 --> 03:13:52,320
didn't I didn't like it at all.
I can. I can hardly imagine

3228
03:13:52,320 --> 03:13:55,770
anyone like that one was just
weird. is just a one with

3229
03:13:55,770 --> 03:13:58,620
Kristen Stewart. I don't
remember

3230
03:13:59,100 --> 03:14:01,770
it. That's the hot movie that's
triggering a lot of this.

3231
03:14:01,800 --> 03:14:06,480
That's the new one. Let me see.
Tommy No. I think that is the

3232
03:14:06,480 --> 03:14:11,310
one because we saw it. Yeah,
what is the name of this one

3233
03:14:11,310 --> 03:14:11,580
though?

3234
03:14:13,590 --> 03:14:14,130
Yeah,

3235
03:14:14,160 --> 03:14:17,760
I think that's the one well, it
just looked boring. It didn't

3236
03:14:17,760 --> 03:14:20,430
look like a fun and I don't
care. It was two women who gives

3237
03:14:20,430 --> 03:14:23,400
a crap but that's not the story
is not a Christmas story. It has

3238
03:14:23,400 --> 03:14:28,230
to be all it's about coming out.
which I understand is something

3239
03:14:28,560 --> 03:14:33,120
very important, but it wasn't to
me. It just really wasn't a

3240
03:14:33,120 --> 03:14:37,110
Christmas movie. The happiest?
You're the last

3241
03:14:38,370 --> 03:14:40,560
guy interacting with the glad to
woman's

3242
03:14:40,590 --> 03:14:42,330
Yes. Oh, come all ye faithful.

3243
03:14:43,440 --> 03:14:45,390
It was risky to show LTP

3244
03:14:45,990 --> 03:14:48,570
Hold on a second. I don't think
it was all come all ye faithful

3245
03:14:48,570 --> 03:14:49,920
is the Christmas story movie.

3246
03:14:50,070 --> 03:14:53,310
No, no, that's that's my new
movie that I'm putting together

3247
03:14:53,310 --> 03:14:55,950
for our gay for our gay
holidays. Hello.

3248
03:14:56,940 --> 03:15:01,860
It was risky to show LGBTQ
people in Their minds, because

3249
03:15:01,860 --> 03:15:04,710
it could cost them business. And
now what they've realized

3250
03:15:04,710 --> 03:15:06,930
because of the population growth
because of the younger

3251
03:15:06,930 --> 03:15:10,860
generation, because it's been
proven time and time again, that

3252
03:15:10,860 --> 03:15:15,000
it is actually a really good
business model to be diverse and

3253
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:18,540
inclusive. They're realizing
that the real risk is leaving

3254
03:15:18,540 --> 03:15:21,720
communities out. You know,
circuit

3255
03:15:21,720 --> 03:15:25,710
Ellis was reminding me that it
was just last year that the

3256
03:15:25,710 --> 03:15:29,520
Hallmark Channel they had a
commercial featuring same sex

3257
03:15:29,520 --> 03:15:34,560
couple at a wedding, and it was
pulled down because there was a

3258
03:15:34,560 --> 03:15:38,190
backlash and they removed it.
And then they apologized for the

3259
03:15:38,190 --> 03:15:42,690
removal. And she had to explain
to her children why that

3260
03:15:42,690 --> 03:15:47,160
commercial was pulled from air
and then contrast stop the clip.

3261
03:15:47,160 --> 03:15:47,790
Just a few

3262
03:15:49,830 --> 03:15:54,090
that is bullcrap. Okay, have you
in your entire you raised the

3263
03:15:54,090 --> 03:15:58,530
kid? I've got kids, you have
never heard a kid ever say, hey,

3264
03:15:58,530 --> 03:16:03,330
Mommy, Daddy, why did they pull
that commercial? First of all,

3265
03:16:03,360 --> 03:16:04,800
that would be notice.

3266
03:16:05,039 --> 03:16:05,789
Never.

3267
03:16:06,720 --> 03:16:11,160
It's a bull crap story. This is
the CBC lying to the public. By

3268
03:16:11,160 --> 03:16:15,420
the way. No Kid ever says hey,
why did they pull the ad with a

3269
03:16:15,420 --> 03:16:17,880
the kid would know they pull the
end? Why would the kid cares and

3270
03:16:17,910 --> 03:16:21,300
add For God's sake. So let's
back it. I'm gonna go sorry. I

3271
03:16:21,300 --> 03:16:23,370
just couldn't take that. Take
it.

3272
03:16:23,430 --> 03:16:28,020
Can I ask your question? Is is
Kristen Stewart? Is she gay? She

3273
03:16:28,020 --> 03:16:31,920
loves me. Yeah, she is. I didn't
know that. Yeah,

3274
03:16:32,160 --> 03:16:35,220
she Oh, no. She went she came
out like a couple years ago.

3275
03:16:35,490 --> 03:16:38,550
Oh, okay. So that's why she's
allowed to act in this. I was

3276
03:16:38,550 --> 03:16:39,240
just wondering,

3277
03:16:39,660 --> 03:16:42,330
okay, well, she brings this up.
By the way, I know what you're

3278
03:16:42,330 --> 03:16:45,180
going with this? Which is why
why are we allowing straight

3279
03:16:45,180 --> 03:16:48,750
actors to play gay character?
Yeah. She brings up the fact

3280
03:16:48,750 --> 03:16:50,910
that we're gonna if we go to
she's actually wise in this

3281
03:16:50,910 --> 03:16:54,690
regard. She says, we can't
really adopt that policy,

3282
03:16:54,690 --> 03:16:59,070
because we won't let straight
actors play gay characters that

3283
03:16:59,070 --> 03:17:01,950
we can't let gay actors play
straight characters.

3284
03:17:01,980 --> 03:17:04,470
Yeah, good luck with that
argument, moved it. And then

3285
03:17:04,470 --> 03:17:08,970
they apologized for the removal.
And she had to explain to her

3286
03:17:08,970 --> 03:17:13,290
children, why that commercial
was pulled from air. And then

3287
03:17:13,290 --> 03:17:17,160
contrast that to just a few
weeks ago, where Sarah Kate

3288
03:17:17,190 --> 03:17:22,410
Ellis, and her wife and her
kids, got out the hot cocoa, got

3289
03:17:22,410 --> 03:17:27,120
out the cookies, sat down on the
couch and watched happiest

3290
03:17:27,120 --> 03:17:31,200
season with these big fancy
Hollywood stars. And I asked her

3291
03:17:31,200 --> 03:17:32,910
if he felt like Piglet.

3292
03:17:33,029 --> 03:17:37,979
I literally couldn't believe it.
You know, I mean, having grown

3293
03:17:37,979 --> 03:17:39,329
up LGBTQ.

3294
03:17:40,590 --> 03:17:46,260
I think oftentimes, we haven't
really known what life was going

3295
03:17:46,260 --> 03:17:51,720
to be we didn't see a path in a
lot of ways. And I would have

3296
03:17:51,720 --> 03:17:54,780
never thought that moment would
have ever existed if you asked

3297
03:17:54,780 --> 03:17:58,290
me at twit would have ever
existed if you asked me at 21.

3298
03:17:59,970 --> 03:18:02,610
And so it was it was kind of
amazing.

3299
03:18:03,810 --> 03:18:06,810
What a difference of a sea
change that we're seeing. And

3300
03:18:06,810 --> 03:18:11,400
that's not to say the work is
done. You talk to creators, you

3301
03:18:11,400 --> 03:18:14,730
talk to critics, there's still
more that needs to be done in

3302
03:18:14,730 --> 03:18:19,110
terms of people of color in
these films, kind of a wider

3303
03:18:19,110 --> 03:18:23,970
spectrum of characters in these
LGBTQ storylines, and that's the

3304
03:18:23,970 --> 03:18:27,270
challenge of the winning you
only have a few of these films.

3305
03:18:27,360 --> 03:18:29,490
They have to kind of shoulder
everything they have to

3306
03:18:29,490 --> 03:18:33,630
represent all things for all
people but as we get more we'll

3307
03:18:33,630 --> 03:18:37,890
start to see more of those
issues solved on screen and

3308
03:18:37,950 --> 03:18:41,280
everyone can enjoy their missile
tomash Okay,

3309
03:18:41,550 --> 03:18:42,210
again,

3310
03:18:42,750 --> 03:18:46,080
it's a bad movie. It's not a
good Christmas movie. They

3311
03:18:46,080 --> 03:18:48,270
missed the mark as far as I'm
concerned.

3312
03:18:48,570 --> 03:18:52,080
They really miss this this is
they're gonna dis just missing

3313
03:18:52,080 --> 03:18:56,130
the mark is gonna continue as
long as identity politics sneaks

3314
03:18:56,130 --> 03:18:59,190
into the movie industry. And
like he said right at the end

3315
03:18:59,190 --> 03:19:02,250
there because he's all in on
this idea. Oh, well you know

3316
03:19:02,250 --> 03:19:06,870
what? We got to get some black
gays in there. Oh, yeah. We got

3317
03:19:06,870 --> 03:19:08,640
to get all these different kinds
of gays.

3318
03:19:09,870 --> 03:19:13,650
White gay or not the right gay
you're wrong gay. Oh my

3319
03:19:13,650 --> 03:19:18,480
goodness. It's Yeah, you're
right this to say it's sad. Sad

3320
03:19:18,480 --> 03:19:22,170
does happen. Look, I'm a sucker
for a great rom com Christmas

3321
03:19:22,170 --> 03:19:26,820
movie. This was not it had
nothing to do with the sexual

3322
03:19:26,820 --> 03:19:31,860
orientation it was this the
storyline? I want Kris Kringle.

3323
03:19:35,160 --> 03:19:35,910
That's Chris

3324
03:19:36,750 --> 03:19:39,300
screen. Kris Kringle has to be
gay.

3325
03:19:39,960 --> 03:19:42,960
That's right. Hey,

3326
03:19:43,320 --> 03:19:47,220
no to sell for next year. Dana.
called Dana. We got a great

3327
03:19:47,220 --> 03:19:51,000
movie. Kris Kringle is queer.

3328
03:19:51,090 --> 03:19:51,750
