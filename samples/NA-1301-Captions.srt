Adam Curry Jhansi devora

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,859
award winning media
assassination Episode 1300 This

3
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,719
is no agenda, pinning down dates
and broadcasting live from

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,719
opportunity's own 33 here in the
frontier of Austin, Texas

5
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,459
capital of the drone Star State,
everybody. I'm Adam Curry from

6
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,879
Northern Silicon Valley where
we're drinking instant coffee.

7
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:30,989
I'm Jesse Devaraj.

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,100
Wait a minute. Wait, you are
your ground zero of the

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,220
tyrannical lockdown in
California. And that's all you

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,780
got? Is your drinking coffee.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,330
So I look at the I looked up, I
always look these orders up and

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,780
actually read them. Nobody does
that the media especially well,

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,080
no, because they're exempt and
they don't care. No, actually,

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,930
they're not exempt from this.
Oh, what media is not exempt

15
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,400
from this? No, apparently
everyone is Whoa, including

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,350
protesters. Protesters in curl,
okay. Just want to make sure we

17
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,400
still have it and it is listed.
Okay, let us know what's in the

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,370
order. Well, how are you? How is
your movement being restricted?

19
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,810
Uh, if you start to look,
actually look at the order and

20
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,260
read the document, you can go
out and do whatever you want.

21
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,080
Wait a minute, just this, you're
just discouraged. Really? Yeah.

22
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,840
And the thing is, of course, all
the restaurants and everything

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,850
is close. So if you go out and
do whatever you want, what are

24
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,330
you gonna do? This is like my
idea of going to Paris, I would

25
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,880
love to get on a plane and go to
Paris. What am I going to do be

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,300
locked down for 14 days? Even if
I wasn't locked down? Like what

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,310
hotel? Am I gonna stay? What am
I going to do when I'm there? I

28
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,050
can't go to a cafe

29
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,270
doesn't move is closed. Right.
But the the shutdown of

30
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,910
businesses and restaurants
that's being enforced?

31
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,990
Yeah. Okay. It's being enforced,
but they're not enforcing people

32
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,630
being outside. And do you have
to wear a mask in your own bed?

33
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:06,270
Is that part of the I'm serious
a wish? It's possible. No,

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,720
that's coming. This is this
order, which to me, just on its

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,440
face feels like I could I'm
probably wrong. But it feels

36
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,380
like Gavin Newson got

37
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,330
caught being a dick. Everyone
pointed at him and said, You're

38
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,880
a dick. And he went, Oh, watch
this.

39
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,250
Is there any other reason?
Because what they're saying is

40
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,560
completely ludicrous. The stay
at home order is because you've

41
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,370
crossed over the magical 15%
free ICU bed space in hospitals.

42
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,440
Which as we know, is really only
a portion of all of the

43
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,670
artificial construct. Yes. So
this isn't even a flattening of

44
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,380
the curve or anything like that.
This is just saying, Well, we've

45
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,060
passed 15%. If we're below 15%
capacity, then we have to lock

46
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,020
down until January 4. This is
this is not even based on

47
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,770
science. This is based on
hospital man's hospital

48
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,970
management. But you know, it's
like, oh, so do we just need

49
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,680
more beds? Can we then one day
friend. So what they've done is

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,090
they've implemented the harshest
order, which is again, like what

51
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,570
I just said is you can go float
around if you want to, but

52
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:33,000
you're discouraged from it, but
you can. And so there's no media

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,300
exemption, because pretty much
anyone can do what they want.

54
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,630
But again, there's nothing to do
so what would you do that you

55
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,210
might as well stay at home and
eat or watch TV?

56
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,400
Did is only a few counties that
are really put it into full

57
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,360
force. Mm hmm. All the night and
not all the counties in the Bay

58
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,380
Area except San Mateo County,
right there was

59
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:01,920
Barstow open away San Mateo
County is they are walking the

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,580
the order.

61
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,040
That's Silicon Valley. There's
your irony. Wait, that's the

62
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,420
Silicon Valley guys.

63
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,340
Silicon Valley.

64
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,890
That's Palo Alto, Redwood City.
douchebag.

65
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,089
So their fancy restaurants.
They're all open. They're in San

66
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,259
Mateo for the Silicon Valley set
is that ideas are out there. I'm

67
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,229
pretty sure for outdoor dining.
You can eat San Mateo County.

68
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:31,919
Yes, they're real. This is on
that. Do you Is there a general

69
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:41,249
feeling in California that this
is some kind of gap? Oh, that's

70
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:44,339
the feeling. Oh, so it's they're
not angry. Gavin Newsome.

71
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:47,009
They're thankful for him locking
them up. That's what you're

72
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:51,449
saying. You got it in Los
Angeles. These orders including

73
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:56,879
that those of Mayor Garcetti are
presenting huge problems. This

74
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,969
video went viral. I've tightened
it up somewhat. This is

75
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,680
A restaurant owner in Los
Angeles who had created an

76
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,500
outdoor restaurant with a little
tent over it and some picnic

77
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,860
tables right next to her, her
restaurant, which has been shut

78
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,580
down now with these orders. And
well, if you haven't seen it,

79
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,960
she sees that 50 feet across the
road, someone else did get a

80
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,170
permit to open up an eating
facility. So this is my place

81
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,900
the pineapple Hill grill in
saloon. If you go to my page,

82
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,140
you can see all the work I did
for outdoor dining for tables

83
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,530
being seven feet apart. And I
come in today because I'm

84
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,940
organizing a protest and I came
in to get stuff for that.

85
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,840
And I walk into my parking lot.
And obviously Mayor Garcetti has

86
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,000
approved, this being set up for
a movie company. I'm losing

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,170
everything. Everything I own is
being taken away from me. And

88
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,580
they set up a movie company
right next to my outdoor patio,

89
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,830
which is right over here. And
people wonder why I'm protesting

90
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,930
and wine I have had enough.

91
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,460
They have not given us money and
they have shut us down. We

92
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,620
cannot survive. My staff cannot
survive. Look at this. Tell me

93
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,720
that this is dangerous. But
right next to me as a slap in my

94
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:26,130
face. That's safe. This is safe.
50 feet away. This is dangerous.

95
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,080
Mayor Garcetti and Gavin Newsom
is responsible for every single

96
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,530
person that doesn't have an
employment that says not have a

97
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,640
job, and all the businesses that
are going under and we need your

98
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,680
help. We need somebody to do
something about this. You go

99
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,740
this Yes, she screwed.

100
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,860
And you're gonna do right. No,
what are they gonna do? Nothing.

101
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,330
Who mean who is they? In this
case? Because Yeah, the

102
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,080
government Jim's doing he's
gonna go and fall on deaf ears.

103
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,640
Yeah, well, we'll see if that
happened in Austin. I'd be out

104
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,580
there. I'd be out there
protecting this like New York,

105
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,180
this is going to happen more and
more. People just want standards

106
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,630
or anything left in New York,
New York. Well, at Brooklyn. I

107
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,060
think there's one restaurant
that is you know, The Last

108
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,890
Stand. And 4000 people a night
are now showing up to stop the

109
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,390
sheriff from shutting them down.

110
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:31,350
tears will come of this. And
people, you know, as you said,

111
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,560
though, that's very interesting.
This order makes it feel and

112
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,710
sound from a distance like you
are locked down, shut up, slave

113
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,640
mask up in your house in your
bed, be quiet, don't make waves

114
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,300
follow the rules. But that yet
you're completely allowed to do

115
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,200
whatever you want.

116
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,600
As an I see no evidence to the
contrary. If you start looking

117
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,850
at the order, it's pretty much
more of a strong suggestion for

118
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,650
the public and a very strong
more than just suggestion for

119
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,880
the businesses. Hmm. So I can go
outside right now and go to the

120
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,820
store, walk around and wander
down to walk through the park.

121
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,640
Well, there is good news. As you
know, the freedom pass is on its

122
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,840
way and we'll get into that a
little more. But just so we all

123
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,240
know, there is a COVID freedom
past.com website, which you can

124
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,550
use to get out of this mental
jail that you've been placed in

125
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,790
this mental prison COVID freedom
past.com

126
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,990
that of course redirects to no
agenda. show.com

127
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,060
This is one of the better
forwards I've seen I really like

128
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,880
COVID freedom pass calm because
we're setting you free in your

129
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,700
head. That's all it's perfect.

130
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,970
So these arguments are spilling
over everywhere. And as you and

131
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,260
I know, whenever we have an
argument on the show people

132
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,580
always resort to this very
childish, literally childish

133
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,230
remark of I hate it when mommy
and daddy are fighting. Which to

134
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,260
me means a new voice for you.
Thank you. Thank you I can do it

135
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,600
again. I hate it when mommy and
daddy are fighting

136
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,350
should like your voice I think
I've had that one for a while I

137
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,480
think it's just slightly I just
got it it's got a little

138
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,080
it's got a tomato in it that I
think makes it

139
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,810
okay cuz I'm really sad. And and
I always say the reason why you

140
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,590
feel that way and uncomfortable
is because this is how adults

141
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,940
actually resolve issues and move
on. And you don't see that on

142
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,650
television. You see phoneys with
phony arguments, feigning phony

143
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,320
outrage. It's not real. That's
why it doesn't feel

144
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,460
uncomfortable. So it hits the
hits the listener, the producers

145
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,310
of the show, gets them in such a
sensitive spot that they

146
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,550
immediately equate that to mommy
and daddy fighting.

147
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,780
There was a really good which is
the problem that the I think

148
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,860
you've identify

149
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Just ignore these comments.
Because that you know, I think

150
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,420
they're people think you're
being cute, but it's possible

151
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,530
that you've nailed a
sociological issue that is

152
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:18,330
serious. Yes. Yes. There's no
examples of what good discourse

153
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,770
is phony discourse, which is
what you see on television. Is

154
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,860
that not exactly the same play?
Yeah, but isn't that exactly

155
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,550
what you see on Twitter when
people argue it's just bullcrap.

156
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,490
But just yelling back and forth
there's no resolution it's not

157
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:39,240
adult behavior it's stupid. Now
the this this descended to an

158
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,230
incredible for me a high for
many a low on CNBC, you probably

159
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,440
saw this. I think it's
worthwhile to play the the

160
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,800
entire clip in context, because
I only play the entire Yeah,

161
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,850
because it was it was just
clipped here and there. And if

162
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,420
you haven't seen it, this is
Rick Santelli, who has always

163
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,690
been kind of a troublemaker on
CNBC. And he's always been a

164
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,480
screamer. Yeah. And he's
appreciated for it. I think in

165
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,980
the 2008

166
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,930
financial meltdown, he was
yelling Yellen every single day

167
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,160
and he was just completely give
a briefing on this. Yeah,

168
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,910
rescued during 2008, which I
thought was on, I thought was

169
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,480
unwarranted, but he did it,
which is that the people who got

170
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,900
suckered into these stupid
subprime mortgages and they lost

171
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:30,870
their houses, and he said,
they're idiots. And they deserve

172
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,020
what they got. Yeah, very
unsympathetic to the fact that

173
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,590
most of them were victims of
sales pitches.

174
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,360
Which is something I'm somewhat
sympathetic towards anyone who's

175
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,490
sold down the river by no means
are kind of buy into it because

176
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,480
they're, I don't know, not
necessarily a bad person. But he

177
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,420
really was very accusatory. I
thought it was unfair

178
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,390
personally, but in this
situation, he's with I believe,

179
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:04,320
David Sanger. Now, Andrew Ross
Sorkin Sorkin I'm sorry, Sanger

180
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,070
Sorkin in New York Times? Yeah.
And Sorkin is from the New York

181
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,800
Times and he's an old New York
Times hack and he would be part

182
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,270
of the system. Oh, yeah.

183
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,680
Somehow the golden boy on CNBC
this what is he done that has

184
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,010
made him so revered people Oh,
Andrew Ross Sorkin Oh, Andrew

185
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:23,580
Ross archive.

186
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,770
We could waltz over to the
Wikipedia and check him out. But

187
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,210
he is a New York Times Golden
Boy there. And he was in fact I

188
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,630
remember talking to him about
him and with some other New York

189
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,330
Times reporters. And you know,
he was one of these guys that

190
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,840
was going to be bureau chief,
which I think he came maybe from

191
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,180
Hong Kong and we went all over
the world if you know what that

192
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,540
means.

193
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,410
A Hong Kong and then he was Oh,
I remember it's because he he co

194
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,910
wrote too big to fail, including
the movie adaptation. And he's

195
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,180
the CO creator of millions.
That's why because he's of

196
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,780
course it's a Hollywood Connect.
And so he was going to be he was

197
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,930
on the fast track to become like
the editor of the New York Times

198
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,660
or The executive editor or
something like that. And then he

199
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,020
gave us very successful with
these books. And he he got kind

200
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,130
of full of himself.

201
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,130
So he like Bay wants to do that.
It's the new york times they'll

202
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,300
just kick you to the curb. And
so he's over now at CNBC is, is

203
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,810
there with CNBC? You know,
unless he can get out of CNBC. I

204
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:32,190
don't see any I think he's at a
dead end. The his problem is

205
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,770
obvious why he's Why didn't
become editor of the New York

206
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,810
Times. He doesn't have vocal
fry.

207
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,250
He's most listened to the
previous editor. You know,

208
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,290
obviously, I read I read the New
York Times, like all day long,

209
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,200
mainly on my iPad. That's what
if that's a Gil Abrams, if you

210
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,110
want to be edited the New York
Times. That's the attitude you

211
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:01,260
got to have. But no. Instead, he
threw on his Superman cape and

212
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,950
flew around Rick Santelli,
telling Rick Santelli, that he's

213
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,270
hurting people is dangerous and
he has to intervene in his rant,

214
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,990
because this is bad for society.
And we need a public service

215
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,710
announcement for health and
safety of our viewers levy I

216
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,740
believe in careful and when I
point out Governor's cheating,

217
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,220
it's not for the high hypocrisy
which exists. It's the fact that

218
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,040
I think many of these governors
that's the point that I think a

219
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,740
lot of people didn't hear it
really it started about the

220
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,340
hypocrisy of the governors and
the mayors of Mayor Adler and

221
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,660
Austin jetting off to the times
to family timeshare and Cabo

222
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,960
when he told everyone to shut up
and stay home then of course the

223
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,430
Newsome and

224
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,920
what is London breed in San Jose
Mayor all of these douchebags,

225
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,860
no, they should just we should
just go towards the French

226
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,890
Laundry. I'm not this is not an
instruction. This is not an

227
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,490
instruction well that do happen.
But if you want to get the

228
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,610
attention of your government
burn down their favorite eatery,

229
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,000
that would be

230
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,020
Start back to the thing at hand
cheating. It's not for the high

231
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,500
hypocrisy which exists. It's the
fact that I think many of these

232
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,660
governors are intelligent
people, and they love their

233
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,930
families, which they've taken
out into restaurants. Therefore

234
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:17,130
there is actually in should be
an ongoing debate as to you know

235
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,330
why a parking lot for a big box
store like by my house is jam

236
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,750
packed. Now one parking spot
open. Why are those people any

237
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,650
safer than a restaurant with
plexiglass? I just don't get it.

238
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,590
And I think there's I don't
think this has really been

239
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,960
discussed. Maybe you and I have
talked about it a couple of

240
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,400
times saying why is this big,
big box store safe? And the rest

241
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,460
isn't? We've talked about this.
No one really does. I bitch

242
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,170
about it. Yeah, you do. You do?
You do. Sorry. But before I get

243
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,780
let this you got to do a lot of
setups here to get make sure

244
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:53,670
this works. A Sorkin is going to
defend the big box stores as

245
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,560
being totally different, totally
different science. And I think

246
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,110
what you might you might make
the argument even though he

247
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,010
doesn't do it, you might make
the argument that well, when you

248
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,910
go into a Costco, which is open,
there is almost like being

249
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:14,130
outside, the roof is a mile
high. There's a lot of airflow

250
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,770
in there. And it's kind of like
being so it's different than a

251
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,320
small boutique. And my
complaint, of course, is that

252
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,680
people can go into target or
Costco and buy clothes, but they

253
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,610
can't go into a small boutique
and buy clothes right? Now, that

254
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,920
argument about the big bucks or
I want people to keep in the

255
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,130
back of their mind that concept
that target doesn't have these

256
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,670
ceilings. Correct target is just
as far as I'm concerned, the

257
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,870
department store. That's why
they agreed. Oh, the target.

258
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,440
Remember, this is a financial
show where they're meant to hype

259
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,550
certain stocks.

260
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,260
To make sure people buy them
open. Why are those people any

261
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,130
safer than a restaurant with
plexiglass? I just don't get it.

262
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,440
And I think there's a million of
these questions that could be

263
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,410
asked. And I think it's really
sad that when we look at the

264
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,320
service sector and all the
discussions we've had about job

265
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,700
losses, that that particular
dynamic isn't studied more is it

266
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,370
worked more, we don't put more
people in the room and try to

267
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,550
figure out ways so that the
service sector employees and

268
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,140
employers could all come back in
a safer way. You can't tell me

269
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,740
that shutting down, which is the
easiest answer is necessarily

270
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,110
the only answer. Rick, I just
just as as a as a public health

271
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,230
and public service announcement.
This is my favorite. As a public

272
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,870
health and public service
announcement. I'm Andrew Ross

273
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,740
Sorkin and I have written
billions. So let me tell you

274
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,190
what the science is for the
audience. The difference between

275
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,600
a retailer

276
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,140
the difference between

277
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,000
the different different, like
how the co host saying who else

278
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,030
man, you know who it is, is the
douche? Who weld Could it be

279
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,860
between a box retailer? Hold on?
The difference between a big box

280
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:01,950
retailer and a restaurant? Or
frankly even a church are so

281
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,560
different? It's unbelievable.
Oh, really a church?

282
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,730
Where I disagree. You're we're
gonna have your thoughts and

283
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,210
science science.

284
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,930
That's the problem. Ah, damn it.
Whenever you and I disagree over

285
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,250
something, john, we the the the
way you used to end arguments

286
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,120
online was your Hitler. He don't
do that anymore. You just say

287
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,600
it's science. If you say that
then End of discussion because

288
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,400
you can't dispute science.

289
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,480
aren't any safer than 150 people
in a restaurant that hold 600? I

290
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,180
don't believe it. Sorry. Don't
believe

291
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,290
there's a lot of restaurants
that have fought back and they

292
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,560
don't have any problems. And
they're okay. You don't have to

293
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,620
believe it. But let me just say
this, you're doing a disservice

294
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,380
to the viewer because the
viewers need to understand

295
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,100
the viewer. You are You are

296
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,130
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It I would
like to keep our viewers as

297
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,220
healthy as humanly possible. The
idea of packing people into

298
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,020
restaurants. I think our viewers
are smarter.

299
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,340
smarter different than all the
viewers like some people do. Can

300
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,660
I get in here please and get

301
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,810
like mommy and daddy baby.

302
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,160
How's it all working for you? I
mean, look at the numbers right

303
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,340
and then this guy Rick, look at
this guy's a douche. This. This

304
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,390
is the fat head guy.

305
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,220
How's that working out for you,
Rick, why don't you just say he

306
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,040
should have just added these
people are dead because of Trump

307
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,110
brick. You know that it's
working out fine.

308
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,450
The numbers lie. Rick, Rick, the
numbers show

309
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,700
that when people are getting
sick and dying,

310
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:52,800
I just stopped

311
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,660
talking about this. There'll be
no agreement. So let's move on

312
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,200
from here.

313
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,510
He's done. They're gonna fire
him. Sorkin or Rick?

314
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,710
I don't think so.

315
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,920
I mean, if they don't heat then
he read book it. If Okay. All

316
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,700
right, that's that's a worthy,
that's a worthy one. If if they

317
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,420
don't fire him, that will be the
equivalent of having tenure on

318
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,800
television, that's for sure.

319
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,510
Because that's, I hear what
you're saying. Let me just see

320
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:44,850
date is December 6 2020. We have
11:31am, JC de AC brick,

321
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:50,730
Santoli? fires and Kelly
Harrison. Yes, it's entirely

322
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,530
over COVID

323
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,080
restrictions. Okay. It's in the
book. I'm not going to dispute

324
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,910
it. I'm not going to dispute it

325
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,640
is the science, on the other
hand is being disputed in a

326
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,000
number of interesting ways. And
this one has cropped up recently

327
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,310
in Ireland. As you can recall,
Ireland has pretty much changed

328
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,480
their population to their four
poster beds, close down the

329
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,390
pubs. And that's like cutting
off oxygen supply. Ireland one

330
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,310
of the most restrictive
regulations that is ruleset that

331
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:33,000
had been put in place. And
there's this woman, Gemma

332
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:38,220
Doherty. And she has spent a lot
of time going around to she kind

333
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,050
of looks like the Code Pink Lady
surname again. You know, I mean,

334
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,960
yeah, I know. He needs to wash
her hair. Yeah, well, yeah, it's

335
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,580
the flashy the flask flask did
kind of blondish hair, thin

336
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,180
hair.

337
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:56,160
And she's spent time going
around Ireland, exposing on

338
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,730
video that the hospitals are
empty.

339
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,470
Which, of course we've seen this
at anywhere. Yeah, you can. But

340
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,840
she's been doing except there's
always one or two places where

341
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,050
you can't. And that's where they
send the cameras. In fact, that

342
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:13,380
reminds me and I have to do
this. And I feel remiss for not

343
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,600
doing it because I've been
thinking about it for days on an

344
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,300
era is these the nbc cbs and ABC
show? People are getting tested

345
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,350
and they show a line of cars.
Yeah. You can't show this on the

346
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,560
show. Because but it's been a
line of cars a mile long. Yeah.

347
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,730
into like a football field lined
up for hours to get tested.

348
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,850
Yeah, I think it's the same line
they show for the food bank

349
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,230
might be

350
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:43,590
Burke, I go to Berkeley this
week. And take a picture of the

351
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,390
testing carline testing thing
there, right. There's nobody

352
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,540
there. But this isn't even
testing this is this is what's

353
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,270
happening in the wards. It's
just it's just not there.

354
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,180
They've cut back on personnel.
No, I'm just I'm just saying

355
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,820
they you can find places where
there's a long line and that's

356
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,300
always in the camera. Yes. So
Gemma Doherty

357
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:10,380
is out and about. And she posted
this, this one video most recent

358
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,620
one in front of Ireland's public
health building and one of these

359
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,580
big, elite Illuminati like
structures. And she had some

360
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,030
interesting evidence, which is
very reminiscent of a time a

361
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:24,930
previous time with the same
actors on the stage. I'm here

362
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:29,220
because I have some very
important information to impart

363
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:33,600
in relation to a development
that has happened in the United

364
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,250
Kingdom. You know, that for the
last eight months, I have been

365
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,410
entering hospitals in this stage
and exposing the fact that they

366
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:47,850
are empty my latest one and the
matter has gone viral worldwide.

367
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,450
And of course, we know it is the
case that these hospitals have

368
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,950
never been emptier. Probably in
the history since since before

369
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,580
beautiful Fini Gail took over.
We know that at this time of

370
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,930
year, our hospitals are normally
packed to the gills as they are

371
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,050
in late February, March, April,
at the end of the winter season.

372
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,730
But they were empty them and
they are empty now. So people

373
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:19,320
are right to question whether
this virus actually exists. But

374
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,300
we now in Europe for the first
time have the scientific proof

375
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:29,880
that it does not exist. And this
is thanks to a Department of

376
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,740
Health letter that had been
received following a request by

377
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:39,930
a citizen in the UK, which he
actually had to appeal. But he

378
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,500
requested the department of
health and social care in the

379
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,330
United Kingdom to give him
scientific proof of the

380
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:54,870
existence of a virus called SARS
code two and they confirmed and

381
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:59,250
I will read it now to you that
the department of health and

382
00:24:59,250 --> 00:24:59,970
social care

383
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:07,830
does not hold any information on
the isolation Tsar's code to.

384
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:12,599
In other words, it does not
exist.

385
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,550
This is this is a real mind
bender. And this is actually

386
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,910
what David was talking about, at
the beginning of this months and

387
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:25,620
months and months ago that the
PCR test is just rigged. It's

388
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,090
not meant to be a test but the
PCR process is rigged to show

389
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,140
fragments

390
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,300
of

391
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,610
a coronavirus and is then
saying, Well, you've got to SARS

392
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:44,010
cov. Two, but no one has
actually isolated the virus. And

393
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:49,320
this is exactly what happened in
the late 80s and 90s. with HIV,

394
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:53,580
they never came up with the
isolated virus they could never

395
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,920
show it. Now, about three years
ago, there's been some paper

396
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,310
released that complicated, you
know, the in a very complicated

397
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,150
manner shows Oh, yeah, it was
the there or something. But in

398
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,780
general, you can read book after
book after book. And then you

399
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,880
just won't find it. And it's the
same people.

400
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,480
And they had the PCR test for
HIV back in the day.

401
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:23,790
And my personal opinion is that
people died from the from the

402
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:28,140
rejected chemotherapy, azt, that
they were giving these patients

403
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,160
they went in very similar to
the, to the, to the ventilator

404
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,360
story. Like you test positive,
you go into the hospital, and

405
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,530
you never come out it dead. You
know, and I think there's

406
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:44,160
something to this. I'm not a
virologist, not an imminent

407
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,210
knowledge disorder. And those
ologists can't even say it, I

408
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,000
can't even pronounce it, let
alone Let them have a diploma in

409
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,170
it. But I'm I'm suspicious of
that, then well, there's a lot

410
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:58,590
of things to be suspicious about
the existence of the virus, I

411
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,440
believe it does exist. I don't
think that come from an animal I

412
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,630
think was made in the lab and
they can't find an animal with

413
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:07,080
it until they've been able to
isolate it, then why is that

414
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,900
something? I don't know that
that's true? Well, that's I

415
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,850
don't know that that's true. I
don't know that. That's true.

416
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,690
I'm just saying,

417
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,190
I just hear this. Now. But I do
know this is true. When the

418
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,690
first reports came out in April
or March, April. And they were

419
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,960
showing all these lines at the
hospitals. They were numerous

420
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,780
youtubers would go out to those
same hospitals the next day. And

421
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,260
we saw that he made those videos
reported on this. And there was

422
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,370
no line of ambulances at those
hospitals. There was no

423
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,230
ambulances, there's nothing
there. And then they went into

424
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,780
the hospitals. Some of them went
actually went in with their

425
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,090
cameras, and they found nobody
in the place to play. It's just

426
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,870
pretty much empty. Right? There
was this example has happened a

427
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,800
number of times. We have a
friend who works at the in

428
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,090
Cornwall at the National Health
Service. And she reports back

429
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,770
that there's no the hospitals
are empty. And you keep hearing

430
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:01,620
this, but there are hospitals
which are reported to be full,

431
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,680
and they can be document to be
full. But those are all they

432
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,040
seem to be the outliers, along
with those long car lines. So

433
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,890
there's something fishy about
this whole those hospitals, the

434
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,620
ones that are better lit, I
guess.

435
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,810
lighting, lighting for the
lighting for the shot. Yeah, you

436
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:23,550
gotta light it up. Because this
sort of thing has been to see

437
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:28,530
this before to get my I actually
had my hair cut. Wow, the other

438
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:28,950
day.

439
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:35,850
And the guy who cut my hair, I
saw I'm just trying to get going

440
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:39,360
here, but I couldn't manage it
would know. You hadn't been that

441
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,300
you'd been a year without a
haircut. No, I was going for a

442
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,590
year. I couldn't get it. How
long did you go? March? Not bad.

443
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,010
Was it down to your shoulders?
It was getting there but it was

444
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,260
a scramble. I look like an old
witch.

445
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,850
But you know, I was I mean

446
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,510
yeah. So I talked to this guy
and he was going to get a an

447
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,320
operation on his back. Yeah,
just before the whole thing

448
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,640
broke out and he didn't let
anybody in. And then he got his

449
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,910
operation during the middle of
the crisis. And he says he went

450
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:18,630
in the hospital because for
electric surgery which is being

451
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,590
done to places dead empty. Yes,
it was great. You go in there

452
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,540
and get nothing but you know
everybody's You know, you're

453
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,040
there you get in the good
service.

454
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,120
So I mean, this these stories,
these stories are not bullcrap

455
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:36,450
stories. Well in more health
related news and numbers from

456
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,430
sir arcane code. He heard us
talking about the ambulance

457
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,860
services and why they were in
financial trouble.

458
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,380
Which we both found indeed kind
of weird. Like seems like no

459
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,800
sense. Well, he has a rundown
for us. He has some friends who

460
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,970
work for an ambulance service
turns out, less than half of

461
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,970
their business comes from
emergencies. The majority of

462
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:04,049
Ambulance Services is for
mundane calls taking someone

463
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:06,659
from a nursing home to their
doctor and back that's a big one

464
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,979
patient from hospital to a rehab
facility or transferring between

465
00:30:10,979 --> 00:30:15,179
hospitals. So when hospitals
shut down everything except

466
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:18,629
COVID related procedures, and
this comes down back to our

467
00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:22,949
point it's shut down all the
more mundane services and so no

468
00:30:22,949 --> 00:30:25,679
more need for ambulance in
general. At least around the

469
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,799
Birmingham Alabama area of the
services many are hurting

470
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,299
financially. That makes sense.
And and we're going to and when

471
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:38,429
this ends when I guess after the
hundred day mass mandate from

472
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:38,939
Joe

473
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,050
you're going to see it then
you're going to see hospitals

474
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,690
overrun when everybody comes
back to get treated for all the

475
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,560
crap that yeah, if they're still
alive, I sweat that's when it's

476
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,870
gonna be bad. It's all this
elective surgery that's been

477
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,000
backing up. Yep.

478
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,920
Yep, you bet.

479
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:02,040
Now's the time people go in now
in the EU a fantastic this could

480
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,900
have been a curry divorce tech,
consulting group exit strategy,

481
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,920
I am beating myself over my head
that we missed this opportunity.

482
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:17,400
I'm very, very disappointed in
myself in you as a consulting

483
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,750
partner, founding consulting
partner, and probably very

484
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:25,950
disappointed in our associates,
known as producers of the show

485
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,980
that no one came up this this
must be really bad. You're

486
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,150
scolding everybody. 97 year old
Collette dupa a nursing home

487
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:36,870
resident in jumaan France has
been taking precautions against

488
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,680
COVID-19. She's been limited to
speaking with her family via

489
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,670
video call or through a window.
But now Dubai is able to feel

490
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,240
their touch through plastic
thanks to an inflatable tunnel

491
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,830
known as the hug bubble, baby.
It even has one of our names the

492
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:56,430
hug bubble. This thing is
fantastic. We could have

493
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:00,480
manufactured them overnight. Do
pies daughters recently visited

494
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,620
her putting one arm through an
airtight sealed plastic stroller

495
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,350
and stroke her hair. Stephanie
Lazo is often at the nursing

496
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:10,800
home.

497
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,180
It has brought comfort residents
would see their relatives

498
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,030
through a window or through a
camera and they were really

499
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,510
missing having real contact and
they are getting a lot of love.

500
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,260
Before dupas daughter's left
they took turns kissing their

mother on the cheek the plastic
after get

502
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,170
disinfects the plastic sheet to
prepare for another loving

503
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,010
encounter in the hug bubble. Do
you see the problem?

504
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,200
The problem?

505
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:47,940
Hug bubble is disgusting. I
mean, and it's all it is is it's

506
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:52,200
a bouncy house, you know clear
plats without the colorful

507
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,330
pieces a bouncy house castle
with two arms and then though

508
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:01,110
your granny comes up you can
stroke her hair with the plastic

509
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,110
it's it's beyond sad

510
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,000
ah

511
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,620
very very very upset. We didn't
come up with that. Dammit. Now

512
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,150
before I go into after that big
lead and I'm less here's like

513
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,580
you're not that upset you didn't
like i think i think it's I

514
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,680
think it's a huge moneymaker I
would have been I would have

515
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,130
been embarrassed to be part of a
company like that called what

516
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:30,930
the hug bubble company. This has
a future baby says a future I

517
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,360
unfortunately, the domain name
is gone. So we couldn't get

518
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,560
that. Before I get into
vaccines. I think you may have a

519
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,200
poor couple of reports to run
through. I did want to make

520
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,120
mention that very observant
producers have noticed in

521
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,540
several of the Bill Gates videos
that he does from his office

522
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,690
when he's doing the interviews
and he's talking about how the

523
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:57,420
severe pain will hurt you from
the from the vaccine. people

524
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:02,010
noticed he had a stack of books
next to him on his Bureau. And

525
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,190
do you know what book is almost
right on top one below the top

526
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:10,680
one. It's called a book called
How to lie with statistics.

527
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:17,700
But an embarrassment man, it's
available on Amazon and it will

528
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,690
give you the blurb there is
terror in numbers writes Daryl

529
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,150
huff in how to lie with
statistics. And nowhere does

530
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:27,330
this terror translate to blind
acceptance of authority more

531
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:31,020
than in the slippery world of
averages, correlations, graphs

532
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,830
and trends have sought to break
through the days that follows

533
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,220
the collision of statistics with
the human mind. With this slim

534
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:43,470
volume first published a 1954
book remains relevant as a wake

535
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:47,250
up call for people unaccustomed
to examining the endless flow of

536
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,280
numbers pouring from Wall
Street, Madison Avenue and

537
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,790
everywhere else someone has an
axe to grind, a point to prove

538
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:58,110
or a product to sell the secret
language of statistics so

539
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,000
appealing in effect minded
culture.

540
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,270
is employed to sensationalize
inflate, confuse and

541
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,560
oversimplify.

542
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,870
I've ordered it. Yeah,
definitely. This is our book. So

543
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,860
that's what Gates is doing. He's
lying with statistics as is

544
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,850
everybody else, everybody? I
don't think so.

545
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:22,889
You don't think so? I think many
of them are very sincere. Okay.

546
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:24,989
But they're confused about what
they're presenting because

547
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,509
someone else gave somebody in
the background, his language

548
00:35:27,509 --> 00:35:31,019
statistics and, and Horton,
swaddling the idiots.

549
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,440
Yeah, yes. Well, do you want to
get him back? Cesar? I see you

550
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,320
have a couple of reports. I have
some let me look at what he got

551
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,650
here. I have a bunch of COVID
there's some good stuff here.

552
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:47,430
Actually. Let's do it. Start
with the grim news from NBC. You

553
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,950
get it like like a feeling for
what's going on. Okay. Good

554
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,890
evening, we've been running out
of ways to stay grim new

555
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,970
milestone, we're talking about
COVID. Now, so far beyond that.

556
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,060
Yeah. This week. It's surpassed
heart disease as our country's

557
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:04,020
top killer. Today, more drastic
measures to try to slow the

558
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,920
spread. Southern California is
now set to go into full lockdown

559
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,610
issuing a stay at home order to
begin tomorrow at midnight, and

560
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:16,230
more states and regions may not
be far behind as the unbearable

561
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,800
burden on our nation's health
care workers grows. For the me

562
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,590
turn this crap off people.

563
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,170
Watch this guy.

564
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,510
You know what happened? You know
what happened? You're right.

565
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,460
They all saw Cuomo get his Emmy.
They're like, Oh, hold my beer

566
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,300
like I can good.

567
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,060
Acting? Yes, of course.
unbearable. It's horrible. Yeah,

568
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,050
it's on bearable right here. If
you want to hear of your top

569
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:50,010
actress. Amy, if I can use that,
if I can use that term. Here we

570
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:54,270
go. COVID report, Amy. Whoo hoo
ha Come on in the United States

571
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,760
has set yet another world
record.

572
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:03,540
virus cases, hospitalizations
and deaths with over 216,000

573
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,770
infections confirmed Thursday
and more than 2800 deaths. Hold

574
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:12,660
on. When she says confirmed,
what exactly does that mean?

575
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,370
Well, let's listen to one of our
Canadian producers who said

576
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:23,670
Do you know that in Canada This
is some semi scandalous is that

577
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,340
when you you're in an emergency
room, you check into the

578
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:31,980
hospital for like a broken leg
and bleeding? Yes. They give you

579
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,640
a covid test. If you give your
test positive, they put it on

580
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,580
the record. If you die from your
broken leg and bleeding you die

581
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,940
to COVID. And it's a confirmed
case because you had a test

582
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,090
right but she's talking about
confirmed cases who are not in

583
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:49,020
hospital just confirmed cases. I
don't know what she says deaths

584
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,470
confirmed guests. Oh Dez. Yes.
And because you had such

585
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,900
excellent use of reverb I'm
going to start it over again.

586
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:59,220
United States has set yet
another world record for daily

587
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,090
coronavirus cases,
hospitalizations and deaths with

588
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:08,010
over 216,000 infections
confirmed Thursday and more than

589
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:13,440
2800 deaths. Nearly 101,000
people are hospitalized with

590
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,450
COVID-19 across the US in
California Governor Gavin Newsom

591
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:22,620
has imposed sweeping remain at
home borders covering the vast

592
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,610
majority of California's
population just in the last 14

593
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:32,100
days close to 1000 Californians
have lost their lives due to

594
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:37,200
COVID-19. The bottom line is if
we don't act now, our hospital

595
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,310
system will be overwhelmed if we
don't act now. We'll continue to

596
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:45,780
see a death rate climb. Governor
Newsome sorter came a day after

597
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,980
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti
warned Los Angeles is nearing a

598
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,030
devastating tipping point,
ordering residents to rain at

599
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:57,240
home and skip social gatherings
in order to prevent needless

600
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,200
suffering and death. in Rhode
Island officials have opened two

601
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,640
field hospitals with a combined
900 beds to relieve hospitals as

602
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,720
COVID cases hit new record
highs. Rhode Island governor

603
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,830
Gina Raimondo says the problem
now is finding enough medical

604
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:18,450
workers to handle the surge on
Thursday she appealed to retired

605
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:23,640
and unemployed health care
workers to join the effort. Wow

606
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,640
first of all dynamite we are
we're both going to hell for

607
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,460
this you realize that that
people think we are we are the

608
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,740
worst human beings in the in the
universe just to put echo and

609
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:39,540
mock mock death. But notice how
she said they're gonna run out

610
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,210
of employees and they're gonna
go get and she says first

611
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:46,650
retired and then unemployed.
Yeah. Why don't you reverse it?

612
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:51,390
Bring all the ones you laid off.
That's what's going on here.

613
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:52,950
Yep.

614
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,410
Yeah, this is a fault. This is
like unbelievable. They pulled

615
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,850
this off. So fake

616
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,320
Fake its fake display part two,
but I'm happy that California is

617
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,660
dumb enough to shut down to

618
00:40:08,189 --> 00:40:12,179
others will follow me and we'll
see the first day I'm on our

619
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:17,039
grid to say I'm gonna ask the
public for 100 days to mass mask

620
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:21,869
up just 100 days to mask not
forever 100 days, and I think

621
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:25,499
we'll see a significant
reduction if we occur that event

622
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:29,519
that occurs with vaccinations
and masking to drive down the

623
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:32,699
numbers considerably.
Researchers at the University of

624
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:36,509
Washington project the US
Coronavirus, death toll could

625
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:43,109
reach nearly 540,000. By April
1, the same researchers recently

626
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:47,609
projected that if 95% of
Americans wore masks

627
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:53,609
consistently, over 68,000 lives
will be saved by March 1.

628
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,760
I want to mention

629
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:02,040
we did saved or created, how
many lives we're going to save.

630
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,650
Is that what she just said? Oh,
yeah, hold on. Let me just hear

631
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:08,070
that last bit. Again, that's
important information. Over

632
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:12,390
60,000 lives will be saved by
March 1.

633
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,100
Why? Wow. So they've got it down
to that much science. So masks

634
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:22,080
work so well, that if we wear
them for 100 days, 68,000 people

635
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,930
will be saved or created by
March 1.

636
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,110
In fact, here's the thing that
is ignored. The San Francisco

637
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,040
Bay Area.

638
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,650
Especially Alameda County, which
incorporates Berkeley, and

639
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,310
Oakland,

640
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:46,530
all very Democrat. Were masked
up. Yeah, of course. I mean, Max

641
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,730
maxed out, maxed up. There are
people driving masks in their

642
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:55,410
cars. There's people jogging
with masses by cyclists going

643
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:58,380
down, right driving around on
the bike lane, and they got a

644
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,310
mask on. So what's the deal?
Here? We're wearing masks like

645
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:06,210
no other part of the country.
This is this is mask Central.

646
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,810
Yet, we're in the purple zone
where we have to shut down and

647
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,990
shelter in place and stay at
home. How does that work? I

648
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:16,050
don't see the evidence for this.
This sounds like both bullcrap.

649
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,620
Because we are masked up. If we
were like, if Berkeley and

650
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,050
Oakland were all like, well, you
guys can do whatever you want

651
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:24,660
now, because you've been a good
little boys and girls, and you

652
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,120
messed up and you stay social
distance. And you have all these

653
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,360
spots on the street where you
stand here and you stand there.

654
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:35,700
We've done that, nothing didn't
help. So this is bullcrap. Just

655
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:40,200
a little side there for you.
Yeah, there's a video from some

656
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,290
UK data scientist. And they're
running the numbers of cases and

657
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:50,940
deaths in the UK. And no matter
which way they ran the numbers,

658
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:56,250
they see a market increase in
cases and subsequently some

659
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:00,330
deaths at one specific date, and
no matter which way they look at

660
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:02,190
the numbers, I'll put it in the
show notes. So you can see it's

661
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:04,260
not clickable because it's
boring and you can't see it.

662
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:11,370
The exact day that masks were
mandated in the UK is when the

663
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,750
cases and deaths started to
increase. Well we've had those

664
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:20,790
those graphs in the newsletter
about five shows ago from the UK

665
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,480
you everywhere all over the
world this this is evident when

666
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,690
you see where the master
mandated all the numbers started

667
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,550
going up because they started
testing now.

668
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,840
So that's this bogus but lets us
know I got two more clips and

669
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,780
we're out of here. Well, I got
some vaccines stuff, but yeah,

670
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,720
don't I want to hear the vaccine
stuff? I have nothing. Okay.

671
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:43,380
First of all, let's play this
one. This is the I have the

672
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,070
world report which is wrapped
around the world with Amy given

673
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:50,370
us all the world. Oh, when did
you get into dy Italy but I

674
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,050
wouldn't play this one because
this one is

675
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,630
a suspicion. This is the COVID
farm workers step away. I want

676
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:01,140
you to pay careful attention to
this and give me the rationale.

677
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:04,530
I don't know why they even
mentioned it. But it makes it's

678
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:07,680
something fishy about this
report. Back in the United

679
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,730
States. California's farm
workers have contracted COVID-19

680
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,480
and nearly three times the rate
of other state residents. That's

681
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,240
according to a new study by the
University of California

682
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,660
Berkeley researchers. The first
report to explore how

683
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,300
farmworkers are
disproportionately affected by

684
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,350
the pandemic. The report also
found farm workers who only

685
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:31,890
spoken indigenous language had
higher positivity rates and

686
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:35,010
farmworkers who spoke Spanish or
English.

687
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,040
Did you hear this?

688
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,350
So what is that depends on what
language you speak. Um, it was

689
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:46,710
the report also found farm
workers who only spoken

690
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:50,400
indigenous language had higher
positivity rates and farmworkers

691
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,290
who spoke Spanish or English. So
what I take away from that at

692
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:59,550
face value is we're not
communicating in the right

693
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:00,000
language.

694
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,240
Because indigenous people, I
don't know what that means, but

695
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,790
around the world, it could be
all kinds of things.

696
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:11,820
American Indians Aborigines

697
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:16,169
that guess because we don't
communicate to them properly. Or

698
00:45:16,169 --> 00:45:18,209
maybe she's insinuating. They're
stupid.

699
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,320
I think she's insinuating
they're stupid. They should

700
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:29,040
learn English, or Spanish, or
Spanish even. Hmm. That is

701
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,650
weird. Well, I mean, she's not I
don't think she thinks she's

702
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:35,850
doing that. But that's in the
report. So you might as well I

703
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:39,120
mean, what else gonna mean?
Because the problem with Amy and

704
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:43,080
that entire news operation, if
you want to call it that news

705
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:47,640
reading, as they never try to
explain anything, they just,

706
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:51,060
they they're just almost like
flat reporters, they report and

707
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,020
they leave you hanging, like why
they leave you, you know,

708
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:59,340
reporting is who went one who,
what, when, where and why. They

709
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:04,470
always leave the why out there's
never a why answered? And there

710
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,660
was a good example right there.
Why, yeah.

711
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,270
I want to know why.

712
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:15,600
David, Democracy Now never
addresses why. And when they do,

713
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,540
it's usually just with some
propaganda. Didn't democracy

714
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,600
now. Don't they have a grant
from the Rockefeller Foundation?

715
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,660
Oh, they got grants from
everybody. We should be so like,

716
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:29,670
well, I'm just stating that for
people who you are new coming to

717
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:33,990
the show, because you heard
about it during the Rona. Or

718
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:39,300
maybe you saw me on the Joe
Rogan or whatever it is. Go take

719
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,060
a look at event 201 people have
asked Hey, have you seen this?

720
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:45,600
It's crazy. They set this up?
Yeah, yeah. Hello 10 months ago.

721
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:52,950
And if you go to if you go to
Bing it.io bi n gi t.io. That is

722
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:55,830
the official no agenda show
search engine which are many's

723
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:59,670
but this one I use. And you put
an event to a one you will get

724
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:02,730
John's clips, which were
excellent, excellently

725
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:07,110
categorized, and many more
articles, etc about this. And so

726
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:10,110
that would make sense that
democracy now is a part of the

727
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:14,550
live version of event event.
201. So say whatever is that

728
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,990
that's the problem with money.

729
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,450
Probably it has control. It has
control is the problem with

730
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:25,590
corporate money with an agenda.
There you go. Money itself is

731
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:30,090
fine. All right. The last one
here's our world report around

732
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:33,120
the world is swinging from
country to country and is always

733
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,730
locking down. I don't know
what's going to happen. Italy

734
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:40,830
recorded 993 new COVID-19 deaths
Thursday a daily record. The

735
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:44,070
Italian government's declared a
national curfew and said

736
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:47,700
Thursday it will bar people from
traveling between regions over

737
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,030
the Christmas and New Year
holidays. Iran's official

738
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:56,070
Coronavirus cases count top 1
million on Thursday in October,

739
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:59,010
a member of Iran's Medical
Association said the true death

740
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,760
toll in Iran could be four times
higher than the official number,

741
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:06,960
which now stands at nearly
50,000. In the Gaza Strip

742
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,080
officials have ordered schools
and mosques to close as part of

743
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,610
a partial lockdown as more than
800, New covid 19 cases were

744
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:18,480
confirmed Thursday. Among those
infected are senior members of

745
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,600
Hamas, including its leader.
Yeah, yes. Anwar, what Hamas has

746
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:30,060
been infected. She's got to stop
saying people are infected. It's

747
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,260
just not true.

748
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:35,700
Because Because the PCR shows
something doesn't mean you're

749
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:41,100
infected and seething with
virus. I'm telling you, I think

750
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,010
they put an end to this real
quick if they made them check

751
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,490
everyone with the same exact
test with the same revenue, you

752
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:54,330
know, the same cycles for for
AIDS as tuberculosis and maybe a

753
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,850
half a dozen people wouldn't
want to test so fast as what

754
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:57,450
you're saying.

755
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,530
Well, yeah, cuz you're gonna
come up positive.

756
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,060
Even

757
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,560
the Baltimore Ravens, you know,
they had their their guys test

758
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,670
positive. And as part of the
shaming, as we know, it's like,

759
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:15,060
well, you clearly didn't do it,
right. You didn't mask up, you

760
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:18,420
didn't follow the rules. You're
probably a republican Trump

761
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,010
lover. That's why you're sick.

762
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:24,600
So they had to counter that
narrative was true. They had to

763
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,080
counter that narrative. And they
came up with a good one, which

764
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:33,450
is a well there were at least
four unique strains of COVID-19

765
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:37,110
found inside our facility. Three
of the four were stopped and not

766
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:40,740
spread. Unfortunately, the
fourth was a highly contagious

767
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:44,850
strain and spread throughout
before we can get to it. I mean,

768
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:49,320
this is this is the thing this
is fantasy, fantasy and for

769
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:54,990
those of you in question, if you
if you test positive if you feel

770
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:59,970
sick if you contract the this
virus

771
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:05,129
It's not your fault. It's not
your fault. It's It's like

772
00:50:05,129 --> 00:50:08,249
saying, you know that got well
that's like the guy. We played

773
00:50:08,249 --> 00:50:11,759
that clip from that YouTuber who
was crying. Yeah, yes.

774
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:18,240
I did everything right. I did
everything right, I still got

775
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:18,480
it.

776
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,910
I think a lot of people that
have that kind of attitude and

777
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:26,430
you have that kind of reaction
make themselves sick. I think

778
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:32,580
that I think yes, good. Porsche
suffers. They're psychosomatic.

779
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:36,750
Oh, definitely. And that's what
the undercover nurse told us in

780
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:39,570
March as well. It's a people
coming in have severe anxiety.

781
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,760
That's why they have heart
palpitations, shortness of

782
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,880
breath. They're freaking out in
New York at the time.

783
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,560
Here's deal going on that the
media has done nothing, you

784
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,310
know, you can take this like
stock market reports. You can

785
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:58,620
take a look at anything up or
down and spin it in a positive

786
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:02,280
manner or a negative manner.
They have done nothing and you

787
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,390
can spend this entire situation
in a very positive manner if you

788
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:10,320
wanted to. But they don't want
to No, of course not.

789
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:14,610
This is an excellent example of
shaming certainly at the end of

790
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,610
the clip, and it also shows you
that you do not want to mess

791
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:22,710
around in Maryland, as a guy is
going to jail for a year. Sean

792
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:25,950
Marshall Myers will spend a year
in jail in Charles County,

793
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:29,970
Maryland. He was arrested around
seven months ago after officers

794
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:33,990
found more than 50 people
hanging out around a bonfire at

795
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:38,310
his home when COVID restrictions
were at their strictest and this

796
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:41,580
gentleman was ridiculous.
Charles County State's Attorney

797
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:45,390
Tony Covington tells me police
arrested Myers at his home for

798
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:49,320
refusing to comply with Governor
Larry Hogan emergency order

799
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,160
against large gatherings of more
than 10 people at the beginning

800
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,610
of the pandemic in March. The
sheriff's office says it was the

801
00:51:56,610 --> 00:52:00,390
second time Myers hosted a large
gathering at his house. And he

802
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:03,420
was accused of being
argumentative with officers in

803
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,990
both time today, Myers was
sentenced to one year in jail, a

804
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:11,370
$5,000 fine, and three years on
supervised probation. These

805
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:14,820
decisions were made for the
public good for people safety.

806
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:20,250
We've got 200,000 people dead
because of the attitudes that

807
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,060
Mr. Myers demonstrated that
particular day. That's the

808
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:28,050
problem, whoever that guy is su
brother.

809
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,840
And that's that Hogan character.
We brought him into the show

810
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,740
some time ago. And she was he
was interviewed by Margaret

811
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:41,790
Hoover. And the two of them were
just hating on Trump. And he's a

812
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:45,360
republican. He's like one of
these worse than a rhino types.

813
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:51,600
Guys a creep. Yeah. But this is
this is the narrative is 200.

814
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:56,310
Now it's 300,000 people are dead
because of people like you

815
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:01,440
because you now, you thought
that adding a little bit of

816
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:06,120
reverb to Amy talking about how
the United States is number one

817
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,100
would be great. But it's number
one, it's nothing nothing

818
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:15,660
compared to the UK health
minister, who really really

819
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:20,310
knows they're number one, as the
UK is the first to administer

820
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:25,050
the vaccine. And lastly, did the
fact that Britain is in the

821
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:28,800
process of unhas Brexit it did
that mean we got the vaccination

822
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:32,310
a world first ahead of the US
and the EU? Yes or no? Do you

823
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:35,190
believe Secretary of State?
Well, I just reckon we've got

824
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,260
the very best people in this
country and we've obviously got

825
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,380
the best medical regulators much
better than the French had much

826
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,720
better than the Belgians have
much better than the Americans

827
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,090
now that doesn't surprise me at
all because we're much better

828
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:50,130
country than every single one.
So it did help that we Yeah, I

829
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:55,590
someone lying when they do that.

830
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:59,070
Let's listen again. That doesn't
surprise me so because we're

831
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:02,040
much better country than every
single one. So it did help that

832
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:08,880
we Brexit it finally, II to get
back there. No, no, no, it's

833
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,820
just a stutter, right? It's not
it, there's no underlying

834
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,090
meaning.

835
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,160
The guy's going to full on CPU
overload

836
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,240
is like his hard drive and
writing fast enough that was

837
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,870
finished in our medical
regulator making it happen means

838
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:27,810
that people in this country are
going to be the first ones in

839
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:30,810
the Western world to get that
fat fire or in the world to get

840
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:34,080
that Pfizer vaccine. Real
competitive advantage, but you

841
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,530
know who it's down to. It's down
to those brilliant brilliant

842
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:42,390
clinicians in the regulator
who's made it happen so fast. So

843
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:46,950
this is a problem because this
is not just the vaccines. This

844
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:52,200
is not any vaccine. It's the
Pfizer vaccine. This plug will

845
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:58,020
not stand as we know the eggs
are in the modern a basket

846
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,000
ladies and gentlemen. This is
the

847
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,140
One that Fauci has a patent is a
part of the patent. That's how

848
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:07,770
it works. By the way, it's all
it's all aboveboard, when the

849
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:11,970
National Institutes of Health
and certainly Fauci US

850
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,260
Department of death, when they
work on stuff with the

851
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:20,100
pharmaceuticals, they are listed
and added to the patents and get

852
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,610
payments to get royalty Pat
payments for that. So Fauci

853
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,790
he poo pooed it. And he said,
this is maybe maybe not the

854
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:34,410
smartest thing to do. The BBC
has a very good report of what

855
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:40,020
he said that offended and the
rather lengthy as sucking he did

856
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,050
to get back in good graces with
Pfizer, because has nothing to

857
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:46,500
do with you, UK has nothing to
do with your health, or the

858
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:51,210
vaccine. It only has to do with
the money. And the promotion of

859
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:55,680
Pfizer, which we identified on
the show hat was the one to win,

860
00:55:55,770 --> 00:56:00,180
according to our insiders. Now
Madonna is not rolled out yet.

861
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:03,660
That has not been the choice of
the UK. And it's a problem for

862
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,600
Dr. Fauci, UK announced
yesterday, it will become the

863
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,570
first country in the world to
approve that vaccine, meaning

864
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:12,870
mass injections can begin next
week in Britain, in defending

865
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,120
the approach of America's
regulator, which is more

866
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,970
cautious to Anthony Fauci
initially took a swipe at

867
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:21,510
Britain accusing its regulators
of taking a shortcut. In an

868
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:26,040
interview on CBS News, if we had
jumped over the hurdle here

869
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,540
quickly and inappropriately to
gain an extra week or a week and

870
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:34,830
a half, I think that the
credibility of our regulatory

871
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:37,860
process would have been damaged,
and we would have more people.

872
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:40,080
You know, I love the Brits.
They're great. They're good

873
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,380
scientists. But they just took
the data from the Pfizer

874
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:46,380
company, and instead of
scrutinizing it really, really

875
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,140
carefully, they said, Okay,
let's move it. That's it. And

876
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:53,550
they went with it. Now, how
about that, huh? He saw he's

877
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:54,270
giving it to them.

878
00:56:55,470 --> 00:57:00,120
And I think the most egregious
accusation is Oh, they just took

879
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,080
on face value. It was in the
they took the test. Pfizer said,

880
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,650
Okay, we're good to go. Pfizer
says it's good, let's go, we're

881
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:10,650
good. They, they believe
whatever they were told those

882
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:15,180
idiots. So transparent what is
going on here? Well, after

883
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:20,190
blistering criticism from across
the Atlantic in the UK, he told

884
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:23,190
me earlier that he apologizes
for those comments, and they

885
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,970
have the utmost respect for his
UK scientific colleagues. Now

886
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:30,780
listen to this suck up job.
First of all, there really has

887
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,180
been a misunderstanding. And for
that,

888
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:39,510
for that, I do have great faith
in both the scientific community

889
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:43,350
and the regulatory community at
the UK. And anyone who knows me

890
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:46,410
and my relationship with that
over literally decades. Know,

891
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:50,160
that's the case. Pfizer, I
really do love you. I'm sorry, I

892
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,770
didn't mean that. I was just
promoting my own house. I know

893
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,830
I've got other deals with you.
I'm sorry, the point that was

894
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:59,670
really trying to make and and I
did not make it appropriately

895
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:02,370
well, and that's the reason why
I welcome the opportunity to get

896
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:05,970
on your show, wow, is this, I've
never heard him suck like this,

897
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,360
and say that I do have
confidence it came out wrong.

898
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,870
And that was not the way I meant
it to be. In the United States,

899
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:17,460
there is such a considerable
amount of tension of pushing

900
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:23,160
back on the credibility of the
safety and the efficacy that

901
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:27,480
notice what he's doing. The
problem is not that Fauci is a

902
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:32,220
commercial a whole. The problem
is, Americans are conspiracy

903
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:35,220
thinkers. That's the problem,
you see, because we don't trust

904
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,010
the vaccine. So yeah, I mean,
it's really it's really the

905
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:41,340
Americans, please just don't, I
didn't mean that it's their

906
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:46,110
fault. If we in the United
States had done it as quickly as

907
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:50,040
the UK did. And that's no
judgment on the way the UK did

908
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:53,310
it. And even though my
misstatements did come across

909
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:57,000
looking that way, that if we
had, for example, approved it

910
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:01,140
yesterday or tomorrow, they
likely would have been pushed

911
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:07,620
back on an already scrutinizing
society that has really, I

912
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:10,770
think, in some respects in the
United States, too much

913
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:16,110
skepticism about the process. So
when we had conversations, and I

914
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:19,890
had just had a recent
conversation with a UK station,

915
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,460
the first thing they said was,
aha, we beat you to it, we won

916
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:27,720
the race. And I wanted to get
the point. This is not a race,

917
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:31,800
where there's one winner, and
one good one and one bad one.

918
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:36,570
It's a bunch of companies and a
bunch of countries, trying as

919
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:41,910
best as possible to get vaccine
to their citizens as quickly as

920
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:44,820
they could possibly suck up some
more to do that in the United

921
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:49,890
States. But our process is one
that takes more time than was

922
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:54,210
taken with the UK. And that's
just as the reality I did not

923
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:57,870
mean to apply any sloppiness
even though it came out that

924
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:00,000
way. So if it did, I just

925
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,610
Want to set the record straight?
I have a great deal of

926
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:06,630
confidence in what the UK does
both scientifically. And from a

927
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:10,710
regulatory standpoint. If I
somehow came across differently,

928
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:11,340
I apologize.

929
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:17,280
Already. Yes. Now, you know what
this is all about. Right. Well,

930
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:20,250
there's, there is something but
I don't know if it's well, you

931
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:24,330
know, it was. It was a simple
phone call from the, from the

932
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:28,980
Pfizer rep that has the CBS
account, of course, first a

933
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,060
media buyer.

934
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:36,600
Yes, we can. Hello, CBS. We
heard what you're you put on the

935
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:41,940
air that kind of demeaned our
company when you're Mr. Fauci,

936
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:44,790
the expert there said that they
just read our tech sheet and

937
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:49,110
we're liars. And I want to point
out to you something. Have you

938
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:52,050
looked at the balance sheet of
how much advertising money we

939
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:55,650
spend with your network compared
to Madonna for our boner pill,

940
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:59,880
which is modern spend with your
network? Zero? They've never

941
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:04,050
done anything. So do you? Are
you going to sit there and let

942
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:07,170
and let this kind of stuff pass?
We're not going to put up with

943
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:10,350
it. Unless you want us to pull
all the ads. Every ad we do with

944
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:13,170
every subsidiary and every
company we have anything to do

945
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,720
is we're going to pull from CBS
and move it over to NBC. Is that

946
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,740
what you're asking us to do?

947
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,130
there on the phone that that
answer real salary? Of course,

948
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:28,470
there is an actual problem,
according to the literature from

949
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:35,940
Oxford, that the Pfizer vaccine
may may result in sterilization.

950
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:42,060
Which I get that what there's
that And don't forget, there's

951
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:45,720
the other one, it may only last
90 days. Well, yes, that's

952
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,720
another good one. But the
sterilization has put the

953
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:53,580
conspiracy theories into high
gear, obviously, I have not

954
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:56,790
heard this. Oh, yeah, it's good.
And it's backed up, I think

955
01:01:56,790 --> 01:02:00,870
poorly. But I did want to play
this short clip, by Sir john

956
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:05,520
bell of Oxford. He's also a
member of GAVI, which is the the

957
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,750
vaccine Alliance headed by
gates, the genius for GAVI and

958
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:14,430
sage, which is the advisory
organization to the UK

959
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:19,020
Government. And he said this in
a in an interview, which I think

960
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:22,800
was his old, I think it's at
least a month old, but it's

961
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:27,180
going around as see. So I'm
hoping that's going to happen

962
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:32,430
pretty smartly this autumn. But
then don't forget there, these

963
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:35,220
vaccines are unlikely to
completely sterilize the

964
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,090
population, they're

965
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:42,000
unlikely to sterilize the
complete population. Now. I

966
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,960
believe he meant as in that
would clean you have any

967
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:53,100
infection these infected you
know, but as as a as a high end,

968
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:58,440
sir, no, no less from PR
agencies exists? Yeah. What did

969
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,380
he use a different term
inoculated? Wouldn't that be the

970
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:07,440
term, but he says sterilized.
And it only plays into the

971
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,250
classic Bill Gates, Ted Talk,
this equation has four factors,

972
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:14,850
little bit of multiplication. So
you've got a thing on the left

973
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:17,970
field two that you want to get
to zero. And that's going to be

974
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:22,440
based on the number of people,
the services, each person

975
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:27,030
choosing, on average, the energy
on average for each service, and

976
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:31,740
the co2 being put out, a per
unit of energy. So let's look at

977
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:35,910
each one of these and see how we
can get this down to zero.

978
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:39,180
Probably one of these numbers is
going to have to get pretty near

979
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:43,830
to zero. That's fact from high
school algebra, but let's let's

980
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:48,510
take a look. First, we've got
population, the world today has

981
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:52,050
6.8 billion people, that's
headed up to about 9 billion.

982
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:57,450
Now if we do a really great job
on new vaccines, healthcare,

983
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,810
reproductive health services, we
could lower that by perhaps 10

984
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:04,890
or 15%. He's always talking
about having less people after

985
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:08,250
saving their lives. I've never
understood this now. There's a

986
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:12,870
possibility that we can connect
the dots. Vaccines will reduce

987
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:16,140
the population it I don't see
how that works, but he always

988
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,550
puts it in the list of

989
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:20,100
reproductive care

990
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:25,290
and vaccines that will lower
that will lower the population

991
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:28,530
and his reckoning with that as
well. In the poor countries,

992
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:30,900
people have 18 children because
they know half of them are going

993
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,440
to die. I don't know. But you
can see rationale for the whole

994
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:38,130
you can see why in combination
was information from Pfizer

995
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:41,640
itself that they're not quite
sure if this will sterilize it.

996
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:46,050
This will sterilize people
general public. Now, we have

997
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:49,500
nothing to worry about. Because
it doesn't matter what vaccine

998
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:53,490
is showing up. Everyone's gonna
take it. Especially you can

999
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:57,330
Denae Viens here's your health
minister again, but will you as

1000
01:04:57,330 --> 01:05:00,000
the Chief Medical Officer of
health in any way make something

1001
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,760
Sort of mandatory vaccination
recommendation. So similar to

1002
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,610
our all our immunization
programs in the province of

1003
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:09,240
Ontario,

1004
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,300
and we have some special acts
related to that, like

1005
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:17,190
demonization of school pupils
act, etc. We can't force someone

1006
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:21,870
to take a vaccine. That's clear.
And because we want to make sure

1007
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:25,110
that people say, is the only
book I would want it. And we

1008
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:27,360
want to make sure we have all
the information they need, as

1009
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:31,230
well as all the safety
information, etc. What we can do

1010
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:35,070
is to say sometimes for access,
or ease and get into certain

1011
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:38,250
settings, if you don't have
vaccination, then you're not

1012
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,470
allowed into that setting
without other protection and

1013
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:45,780
promotional materials. So what
made it mandatory is proof of

1014
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:48,930
immunization vaccination was a
proper product, in order to have

1015
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:52,020
latitude and freedom to move
around in certain, like access

1016
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:54,540
into long term care facilities
or the hospital different things

1017
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:57,900
without wearing other types of
form of personal protective

1018
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:01,830
equipment, etc. Same as a school
attendance may be much like our

1019
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:05,310
other vaccines, we haven't gone
there yet, but we would make it

1020
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:10,020
mandatory for access in and
sometimes be excluded if there's

1021
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:12,330
a risk or hazard going on. So
it's more of

1022
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,550
facility of movement and around
that not that someone is going

1023
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:19,350
to be forced to take it against
their will.

1024
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:23,910
So this is a reason to go to
COVID freedom past.com and tell

1025
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:27,000
all your friends, it truly will
free your mind of everything

1026
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,420
that you're being told. And it
appears to me that we need to

1027
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,510
keep a very close eye on any
stimulus or rescue package that

1028
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:39,360
may or may not come out before
the end of the year. There's a

1029
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,900
lot of talk about it. And let's
pay very close attention to what

1030
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,290
the sectors that goes to. I
guarantee you if a lot of money

1031
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:49,770
is going into airlines, they
probably will come up with some

1032
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:53,010
kind of requirement for proof of
test or proof of vaccination.

1033
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,800
Because it's government
government money, they will they

1034
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:59,370
will Why have the government be
the bad guy, when you can just

1035
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:04,110
pay the commercial and sector to
do it for you. Just like spying

1036
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:07,230
it's a good point. Just like
spying it's the same thing. Why

1037
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:09,720
would we spy we'll just buy it
from you guys commercially,

1038
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:13,290
stupid citizens give it to
Facebook and Google and Twitter

1039
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,390
willingly, willingly.

1040
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:20,940
Not going to be so easy in the
United States, particularly

1041
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,140
amongst the black and brown
communities, who are always

1042
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:27,120
talked about as such in the
mainstream.

1043
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,470
Because the black and brown
communities of America are not

1044
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:35,340
stupid, and they've learned from
their own history. Tuskegee

1045
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:38,580
anyone, just trusting
communities of color is not just

1046
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:41,850
a small town problem. It's
nationwide, a study conducted in

1047
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:45,270
September, exploring the issue
in black and Latino communities

1048
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:51,030
found just 14% of black people,
and only 34% of Latinos trust a

1049
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:55,710
vaccine will be safe. It's like,
it's almost to me like a fear,

1050
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:59,370
like I have a phobia of needles.
I'm almost at the point where I

1051
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:02,640
have a phobia doctors, Carmen
Bailey was diagnosed with

1052
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,510
COVID-19. In April, Bailey says
she avoided medical help,

1053
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:09,660
because she feels she has been
poorly treated by doctors in the

1054
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:13,050
past. Now the grandmother of
three suffers from adverse

1055
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:16,890
effects with her heart, lungs,
and kidneys. Sometimes I could

1056
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:22,380
barely walk alongside of her
know what to do, what she will

1057
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:25,890
not do is take a backseat. We
don't know any kind of side

1058
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:26,820
effects from them.

1059
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:32,640
So I just really felt like at
this point where it's people

1060
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,860
that's gonna take that vaccine
as guinea pigs

1061
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,110
are gonna Yes.

1062
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:43,830
I just felt like you. We don't
know enough. In the I was

1063
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:46,590
looking at the Pfizer stuff
going through the sterilization

1064
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:51,300
part. They were I think only of
the there was like only 15

1065
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:56,070
African Americans in the entire
trial of 30,000. I don't

1066
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:58,590
understand that may not maybe it
maybe I don't have the right

1067
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:02,490
data. But that seemed a little
under under represented to me.

1068
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:05,730
But we have nothing. So numbers
that seem higher than that there

1069
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:07,500
was a percentage and it was
something like

1070
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,480
it was like that was 15% I may
have misread it. But even then

1071
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:13,530
that's a little low.

1072
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:17,580
Particularly because we know
that they suffer

1073
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:18,840
disproportionately.

1074
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:24,540
But don't worry, we have help.
It's all gonna be okay, even

1075
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:27,330
though you're gonna take the
vaccine. And you know why?

1076
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:28,800
Because of this guy.

1077
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:32,880
Anthony falchi tells me this
vaccine is safe.

1078
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:36,690
And can

1079
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:38,490
vaccinate

1080
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:43,950
immunize you from getting COVID?
Absolutely. I'm going to take

1081
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:49,290
it. I may end up on TV or having
a film just so that people know

1082
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:51,510
that. You know,

1083
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:55,740
do I trust this science

1084
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,270
Few people that are actually
experienced in science. In other

1085
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:05,490
words, never don't have a degree
in science never worked in

1086
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:07,470
science to have anything to do
with science are the ones who

1087
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:11,550
say that. Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
I'm sure. Now, I want to read

1088
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:15,540
this. I want to read this little
report we got from anonymous.

1089
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:16,470
Hi, Adam.

1090
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:22,500
Here's the UAE cases continue to
hear they continue to climb. But

1091
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,530
the government's opinion is that
this is normal. And they're

1092
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:28,500
opening everything. restaurants,
bars, gyms, weddings, house

1093
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:32,460
parties and on schools have been
open since September. Oh, and if

1094
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,950
you've ever been here, it's hot.
I've been there. It's very hot.

1095
01:10:35,010 --> 01:10:38,670
damn hot, he says. So none of
this outdoor dining rubbish.

1096
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:42,210
We're all inside an air
conditioned space is no problem

1097
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:45,870
to downsizes you can't talk
about it. So nobody talks about

1098
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:49,620
it because of the authoritarian
state. And they don't it's not

1099
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:50,460
publicized.

1100
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,510
So everything's normal and lots
of parts of the world and

1101
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:57,000
because of I don't know what
what the deal is with these

1102
01:10:57,030 --> 01:11:02,280
what? They're just annoying to
me. Well, no and British

1103
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:06,510
Government. Yeah. I mean, look
at us. Texas is open. We have no

1104
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:10,620
restrictions. Adler trying to
make some noise, but he can't

1105
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:14,010
he's been totally discredited.
And we're having a pretty damn

1106
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,370
good life. We have one of Tina's
friends is over from Chicago. We

1107
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:21,120
went out last night we went to
mangoes fish market which was

1108
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:24,690
open and as full as they can be
for the day. Of course they do

1109
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:27,780
have some restrictions, but
completely packed for what

1110
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:31,770
they've got. Meanwhile, the only
thing opened in California is I

1111
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:35,610
think the the weed dispensaries
are open if I'm not mistaken. So

1112
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:38,430
there's that as the weed
dispensary is that for you?

1113
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:40,170
Definitely open.

1114
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:46,530
So French Laundry is open. Yeah.
Now, should there be a problem

1115
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:52,710
with compliance and people
willing to take the vaccine? All

1116
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:56,010
we have to do is talk to Larry
Larry Lightfoot, I've learned

1117
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:58,290
from our Chicago friend. That's
what they call her in Chicago

1118
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:01,710
now. Lori Lightfoot Mayor Lori
Lightfoot is known as Larry.

1119
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:06,090
And this I thought it would be a
color bait Beetlejuice because

1120
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:09,960
she said that but she's no no
everyone calls it Larry. Larry

1121
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,740
Lightfoot, which is bad enough,
don't have to go to the

1122
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:16,680
Beetlejuice. But she was asked
about this. And well, she knows

1123
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,290
exactly how to take care of this
problem. Would you support

1124
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:20,370
vaccine mandates?

1125
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:24,420
Well, look, I always think it's
better to educate people into

1126
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:28,110
compliance if we can. But we
can't live in a world where only

1127
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:31,140
certain people are taking a
vaccine, and some are opting

1128
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:34,680
out. That won't help anybody and
that will perpetuate the spread

1129
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,800
of this incredibly deadly
violent virus. So we're looking

1130
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:41,580
at a range of options, but our
first choice, obviously, is

1131
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:45,300
educating people into
compliance. I love this term

1132
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:50,100
educate. Wait, yes. How is it
incredibly deadly when the stats

1133
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:55,020
clearly show that it's under 1%?
You need to be educated and

1134
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:59,070
compliance young man. You
haven't been paying attention we

1135
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:01,950
need to educate you into
compliance

1136
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,970
is not the same thing as telling
people to obey.

1137
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:13,680
You must obey not you will obey
you will obey you will obey you

1138
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:17,070
will obey. Educate into
compliance.

1139
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:23,370
That's it That's reeducation
camp. If you don't that's just

1140
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:28,020
rude if you don't pay careful
attention. Yes, the reeducation

1141
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:33,360
camp. Let me see what else I
have. The New York Times says

1142
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:38,940
the true pandemic toll in the US
is is in reality 345,000 we

1143
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:42,300
haven't counted right. So shut
up, slay Oh, yeah, we're low.

1144
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:44,070
Yeah, we're low on the count.

1145
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:49,800
When I was looking over that the
Canadian producers sent over

1146
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:54,450
this information about the COVID
cases. I'm going to read this

1147
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:57,330
because I left a important piece
of information out.

1148
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:01,260
There's a piece of information
missing with the picture of the

1149
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:04,260
hospitalizations caused by the
covid virus done by people that

1150
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:07,380
go to the hospital. They get
tested, when they are

1151
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,080
hospitalized for whatever
reason, and both situations have

1152
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,210
been added to the total that
apparently I know here in

1153
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:14,760
Canada, everyone who is admitted
to the hospital and test

1154
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:18,690
positive with a PCR is added to
the official hospitalization

1155
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:22,710
total of covid patients, even if
they're not in their symptoms,

1156
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:26,310
and the reason they're in the
hospital wasn't the virus. Yeah,

1157
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:32,940
this is a medical scam. Medical
scam, medical industry scam.

1158
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:34,830
Well,

1159
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:39,180
one more thing, one more thing
on the vaccines. There's

1160
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:44,220
a fact sheet going around Well,
actually, what was this this was

1161
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,070
about side effects from the
vaccine and yeah, there's the

1162
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:53,640
typical things that you know,
pain in the arm pain in the ass,

1163
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:58,800
etc, etc. But a lot of the
literature is now changing some

1164
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,000
percept or trying to change

1165
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,350
Perception when we were looking
at the vaccine industry, and

1166
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:08,700
just to recall how we got
interested in it, I came across

1167
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:12,450
the financial conference in
2010. I want to say 2000, maybe

1168
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:17,790
even earlier 2009 It was during
swine flu. Okay, it had to be

1169
01:15:17,790 --> 01:15:21,180
earlier early than that. And the

1170
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:25,200
it was a financial conference at
all the pharmaceutical

1171
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:29,160
companies, everyone agreed. This
was a hundreds of billions of

1172
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:32,970
dollar industry because we could
make vaccines for everything in

1173
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:37,260
the future. This is really what
Madonna is, by the way, this was

1174
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:41,760
that era, that same error when
you discovered this PowerPoint,

1175
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:46,140
that within a year, they were
coming up, remember the vaccines

1176
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:47,370
for smoking,

1177
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:52,260
overweight, all of that none of
them were vaccines in the in the

1178
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:56,220
least, but they were trying to
get in under the umbrella of the

1179
01:15:56,220 --> 01:16:02,790
liability issues, right. Which
is obviously still there. Now

1180
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:03,420
with

1181
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,120
the vaccines,

1182
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:11,130
the one thing we bumped up
against is the use of adjuvant.

1183
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:14,820
And as humans, we kind of
concluded if I recall, in an

1184
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,480
unscientific manner, we're a
little dodgy because they work

1185
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,700
as a form of hamburger helper,

1186
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:25,140
to really kickstart the exact
same phrase you use back 10

1187
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:26,700
years. That's why I remember it.

1188
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:31,620
So now we have a subhead in
these articles, vaccine.

1189
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,650
adjuvants bring the danger we
need.

1190
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:40,650
And they're explaining how,
particularly with these mRNA

1191
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:44,430
vaccines that your immune system
still need some kind of

1192
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:46,560
Kickstart to start

1193
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:48,480
producing

1194
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:52,740
antibody antibodies against
whatever is invaded you like

1195
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:57,690
spikes, yes. And that mRNA may
not be enough. So they add some

1196
01:16:57,690 --> 01:17:04,020
of this Agilent, which just just
makes you your body think that

1197
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:10,020
you're being attacked. And we've
seen some bad results from over

1198
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:14,130
use of edge events. But now it's
being here, edge events are

1199
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:19,230
safe, but designed to inflame.
So the I think this is all part

1200
01:17:19,230 --> 01:17:23,400
of the education process, which
we've seen the survey, we're

1201
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:27,720
seeing the reports, the studies,
how do we teach people? So I

1202
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,150
think that's kind of good, that
going head on by addressing a

1203
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:33,780
lot of the concerns that people
have by lying about them, which

1204
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:34,290
is great.

1205
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:40,140
So you just shouldn't worry
about anything, just we will re

1206
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:41,970
educate you into compliance.

1207
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:47,970
And the final thing just as a as
a conspiracy report, there's a

1208
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:53,040
lot of links now, connecting
Anthony Fauci to Mother Teresa

1209
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,550
and child smuggling show, just
so you know, that's out there.

1210
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:01,050
Apparently, Mother Teresa was
not such a Mother Teresa after

1211
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:01,320
all.

1212
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,990
No, Christopher Hitchens made a
career out of blasting her every

1213
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:11,910
chance he had he just thought
she was a horrible, missed all

1214
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:16,290
that. I miss lectured and
lectured about this was pretty

1215
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:19,620
funny, because I certainly was
the only one. I certainly got

1216
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:22,560
the programming of how to think
about Mother Teresa.

1217
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:26,190
But I didn't realize that she
was so evil.

1218
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:30,930
Not saying she is I'm just
saying that's what we got going

1219
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:35,790
on. He's a saint. So to take us
I'd like to take a break in a

1220
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:37,890
minute. And then we got to come
back. So we have lots of

1221
01:18:37,890 --> 01:18:42,540
election News. I'm going to
spoiler upfront, everything is

1222
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:47,130
China's fault. Just so you know,
the Wu Han flew the

1223
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:52,140
vote corruption and, and
stealing and flipping.

1224
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,110
Everything's China. It all
points back to China. I'm

1225
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:57,840
letting you know now because
that's what you'll be hearing

1226
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,770
over the course of the next two
months. And let's kick it off

1227
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,410
with Gordon Chang, I think
respected here on the show.

1228
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:09,720
who hates China, at least the
Chinese Communist Party, and he

1229
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:14,460
knows exactly is a major major
CCP hate. He's a hater. And he

1230
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:17,850
knows exactly what China is
doing. Well, China's efforts to

1231
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:21,450
collect DNA of the world's
population have been determined.

1232
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:25,200
I mean, they're not only
collecting Chinese people's DNA,

1233
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:29,580
but they're collecting DNA of
everybody else. So for instance,

1234
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:33,060
they've been buying up American
companies that have DNA

1235
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:39,540
profiles, also, they subsidize
the DNA analysis. So if you go

1236
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:43,710
to an ancestry company, chances
are that it is actually a

1237
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:48,810
Chinese business that is looking
at your DNA. And that of course,

1238
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:51,510
can be shoveled on to the
Chinese central government or

1239
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:55,950
Communist Party. Also, there's
been hacking. We know that China

1240
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:58,920
hack anthem, which is America's
second largest insurance

1241
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,000
company, that was

1242
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,680
Discovered in January 2015. So
there's so many different ways

1243
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:09,180
that China is collecting the DNA
to make probably the world's

1244
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:13,740
biggest database of DNA of
people on the planet. I think

1245
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:17,640
that China has at least two
motivations. Well, first of all,

1246
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:21,870
we know that bio business is
very important to them. They

1247
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:26,400
included it in their Natan,
China 2025 initiative, which is

1248
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,850
a decade long program to
dominate certain industries,

1249
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:34,890
including biotechnology. But
also there's something sinister

1250
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:39,780
about this. And that is, we have
heard reporting from Bill Gertz,

1251
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:44,490
for instance, in The Washington
Times that China is probably

1252
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:48,990
trying to develop diseases that
target not just everybody, but

1253
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:52,770
target only certain ethnic or
racial groups.

1254
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:59,010
And there you go, everybody, I'm
glad that you went for your

1255
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:03,510
23andme DNA test good with your
ancestry.com DNA test. They're

1256
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:06,270
gonna design diseases for you.

1257
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,800
Did we not warn for something
like this? Did we not?

1258
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:15,180
Make sure writers have been
talking about a targeted genetic

1259
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:19,500
targeting? Which this may have
already been years this may have

1260
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,730
already been? Yeah, it's very
possible. Well, if we look at

1261
01:21:23,730 --> 01:21:27,480
the fact that apparently nobody
in China, if you're gonna

1262
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:31,170
believe the numbers, has gotten
another version, you haven't

1263
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:34,290
gotten COVID, to what, to
whatever you want to call it.

1264
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:39,120
They haven't caught this virus
in the last nine months are

1265
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:43,560
working at full capacity over
there. And there's no cases, but

1266
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:46,440
everyone in the Western world is
infected.

1267
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:50,130
Of course, then the whole thing
could be a fake on both sides.

1268
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:52,740
But it's beside the point. If
we're if we are to take the

1269
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:56,430
numbers at their face value and
assume it's all true. Bochum.

1270
01:21:56,430 --> 01:21:58,380
China has no cases at all.

1271
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,900
Well, here's what I'd like to
know.

1272
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,320
Where are the dead vaping people

1273
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,240
that came in when so fast? Were
all the people who died from

1274
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,870
vaping they're in the same room
where they got hunter Biden's

1275
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:15,720
laptop. Here's the theory I've
been working on

1276
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:24,480
in so I vape constantly I vape
and it's propylene glycol and

1277
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:28,380
nicotine obviously, isn't it in
these vaccines is also

1278
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:32,370
polyethylene glycol, which is
not far from the stuff that

1279
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:36,900
that is used for the theater
smoke and the and and the vape

1280
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:38,070
vaporization.

1281
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:43,560
These AC two receptors that we
talked about way in the

1282
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,690
beginning and there was
difference in people who were

1283
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:47,790
smokers did or didn't get

1284
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:54,540
the COVID I have a feeling that
a combination of certainly the

1285
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:58,710
nicotine and propylene glycol
has been proven we have lab

1286
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:02,580
tests on and you can look it up
being a.io has been proven to

1287
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:06,480
kill Corona vaccine on the
minute it comes in contact with

1288
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,690
Corona virus. Corona, thank you.
I'm doing a reverse. You're

1289
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:12,360
doing the same thing everyone
else is doing. I did a reverse I

1290
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:16,710
said vaccine instead of diverse.
Yeah, so that's better. But

1291
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:20,940
you're right. Stop me on that
stuff. The AC two receptors,

1292
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:26,460
apparently and I said it is very
similar. The nicotine somehow

1293
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:31,230
attracts the corona virus. This
is just a sum. I'm not a

1294
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:33,870
scientist. So I'll just say at
the end I'll say science and you

1295
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:37,890
believe me, and that the
Coronavirus has tricked away

1296
01:23:37,890 --> 01:23:41,550
from your own AC two receptors
and tries to bind to the

1297
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:44,820
nicotine. So all I'm just
pulling it out together and

1298
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:49,050
saying maybe they wanted to get
kids in particular off of the

1299
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:53,280
vape sticks because we needed to
get them infected. And we even

1300
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:56,640
try it a little bit later on by
saying ha if you if you vape

1301
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:59,910
you're definitely going to get
more infected which isn't it

1302
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:03,210
clearly I have not there's every
reason for me to have been

1303
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:08,790
deathly ill every reason you
take vitamin D three through

1304
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,580
three you might you if you're
going to continue on this line

1305
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,650
of thinking please play the
theremin in the background.

1306
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,960
Okay, I will and with that I'd
like to thank you for your

1307
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,420
encouragement to see in the
morning to you the man who put

1308
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:22,680
in the scene educating into
compliance john

1309
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,610
well in the morning to you Mr.
Adam Curry also in the morning

1310
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:32,010
all ships and sea boots on the
ground feet in the air subs in

1311
01:24:32,010 --> 01:24:34,800
the water and all the days and
nights out there. Are you

1312
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,820
talking through a tube?

1313
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:39,150
I am talking through a tube

1314
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:45,030
to the trolls in the troll room.
Hands up trolls Hands up, hands

1315
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:49,410
up. Let's count you put little
troll counter on. Ooh 2032. Nice

1316
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:54,210
to see it trolls good work on
Sunday. That is the troll room

1317
01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:57,420
available to all at no agenda
stream.com where not only can

1318
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:59,910
you sit there and troll along
with all the others.

1319
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,210
Thunder that digital bridge You
can also listen to this show

1320
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:06,930
live we've got Darren O'Neill
once again did a great rock roll

1321
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:12,090
pre stream show for us and we
got Nick the rat does live stuff

1322
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:15,930
for Rhino the bearded but also
podcast just that are perfect

1323
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:19,560
from all across the gizmo nation
no commercials mostly talk and

1324
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:23,520
certainly no agenda that is the
troll room no agenda stream.com

1325
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,850
and you can ask for an invite
there to no agenda social comm

1326
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:27,510
which is our

1327
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:33,840
algo free social network. It is
federated. So it does work

1328
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,530
across all these other servers
which are all their own micro

1329
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:41,580
communities. And since there's
no algos, the signal to noise is

1330
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:46,080
quite enjoyable and you will
like hanging out there. I did

1331
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,340
want to read

1332
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:53,730
briefly since he sent a note and
we couldn't find it on the last.

1333
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:57,810
I think he became an instant
night David Fox. I just wanted

1334
01:25:57,810 --> 01:26:00,840
to read this note I paraphrase
it somewhere along the along the

1335
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,050
line. Forgive me pod fathers I
have deuced I've been listening

1336
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:07,020
since episode number one donated
off and on over the years no

1337
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:09,300
agenda show is truly a great
product. Not only is the show

1338
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:12,300
great, but the producer network
is outstanding. Recently I was

1339
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:15,270
assaulted to the point I was in
the hospital. The first thing I

1340
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:17,400
remember when coming to
consciousness in the hospital

1341
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:20,790
was the nurse coming in the room
and saying Sir, your friend from

1342
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:24,720
Australia Christmas and wants to
talk to you. That's right. My CB

1343
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:28,410
radio wife Chris tracked me down
in North Carolina from New South

1344
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:31,950
Wales. Then right after that the
second call I got was from DC

1345
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:35,370
girl who'd also track me down at
the hospital. The no agenda

1346
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:39,750
producer network swung into full
effect making sure I was okay. I

1347
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:44,370
had someone checking up on me 24
seven, all of them people that

1348
01:26:44,370 --> 01:26:47,970
have no agenda social talk about
value for value and could not

1349
01:26:47,970 --> 01:26:50,790
agree more. And that is indeed
exactly what's going on over

1350
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:52,500
there. It's really beautiful.

1351
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:57,870
And thank you to farm slave. No,
that can't be farm slave. Let me

1352
01:26:57,870 --> 01:27:01,350
get the right. That was the
previous one. Let me go back and

1353
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:05,610
get the right we had show 1300

1354
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:10,650
and that's interesting. Why show
1300 not showing up here on my

1355
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:14,610
Oh, there we go. title that was
electrical college. And the

1356
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:19,710
artwork. Well, we went with
mountain J's very nice 1300 with

1357
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:21,270
blood like

1358
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:27,840
letters, vampire letters. We had
an audio waveform, our classic

1359
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,280
mic. They was just kind of a
beautiful piece with the white

1360
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:35,820
background. So it looks good on
the white webpages. The best

1361
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:38,820
podcast in history was the the
monochrome this one.

1362
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:44,160
And did we have anything we
needed to discuss about this

1363
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:48,990
about? Well, there was there was
a lot of art lacking. Now I wish

1364
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:51,180
you'd mentioned some of the
artists so they can fit on a

1365
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:55,050
show like 1300 or even
Thanksgiving Christmas maybe

1366
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:58,110
special dates. Yeah, the special
day shows

1367
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:05,160
it's might not be a bad idea to
do something dramatic to the

1368
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:09,420
day. It's not that often there's
maybe 10 a year true, as opposed

1369
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:12,900
to some pawn or something that's
funny about some little moment

1370
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:17,520
in the show. The 1300s Show. The
most important part of the show

1371
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:22,290
was that it was the 1300s show
and it was a lacking number of

1372
01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:26,700
people who picked up on that. I
was kind of surprised Yeah, well

1373
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:29,940
not everyone knows this but
stated as such there was a

1374
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:34,830
couple of there was way too
busy. Most of the art just too

1375
01:28:34,830 --> 01:28:38,850
much stuff in there too many
letters not clear something that

1376
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:43,890
pops off the page. I mean all
valiant efforts, no doubt. But I

1377
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:48,570
agree it's the for those types
of shows getting the big 1300 or

1378
01:28:48,570 --> 01:28:52,770
turkey or Santa Claus or
something like that is kind of

1379
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:56,190
what you want. And for those of
you on a podcasting 2.0

1380
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:58,530
compatible app you can see all
these this art that we're

1381
01:28:58,530 --> 01:29:02,190
talking about right now if you
look at your screen go to new

1382
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:05,340
podcast apps comm to find one
that is compatible with your no

1383
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:09,240
agenda show and we have as part
of our time talent and treasure

1384
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:11,820
value for value system where you
get back whatever you get out of

1385
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:14,250
it. Not only do we have the
great artists Thank you no

1386
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:17,490
agenda our generator calm. But
we have our executive producers

1387
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:21,180
and associate executive

1388
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:22,080
starting with

1389
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:24,060
a

1390
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:27,960
matt love well.

1391
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:34,500
Matt is in McCool kita makikita
I don't know how to pronounce

1392
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:39,060
this and it's an Iowa of all
places mukluk maquoketa Macaca

1393
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:40,350
mK makikita I think

1394
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:48,540
I would go with McQueen
maquoketa Matt qwaqwa $1,000 and

1395
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:54,120
$51,000 ISO five Oh, nice. And
thank you for that I wanted to

1396
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:57,300
make sure your stockings were
full this saint next day I was

1397
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,970
hitting the mouth by my generous
brother.

1398
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:06,180
Mike from MAC Walker rock rock
who donated $556 for me in

1399
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:09,240
October, I would like to return
the favor and get him to the

1400
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:13,920
roundtable where he belongs.
Before the Corning festivities,

1401
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:19,440
the coordinator money coming
coming coming in are you

1402
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:24,870
thankful for some mac and cheese
and a long cut Sharpton, both of

1403
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:29,310
which are plentiful now but will
soon be hard to come by. Mike

1404
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:32,310
can pick up his own night name.
But if he had to pick one, if I

1405
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:36,720
had to pick one farmer would be
Mike Knight of all tradition.

1406
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:42,000
Lastly, is in need of a deducing
we have that

1407
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,450
you've been reduced.

1408
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:50,820
So, okay, so he'll be on the
list and you'll be a use didn't

1409
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:53,970
give him executive producer
credit. So you'll you'll get

1410
01:30:53,970 --> 01:30:54,360
that.

1411
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:57,480
That's not the right mac and
cheese.

1412
01:30:58,830 --> 01:31:02,790
I'm sorry, what is this then?
President Trump said that

1413
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:07,200
because of the killing of Al
Baghdadi make

1414
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:14,970
the world a better place. And I
wouldn't give credit to he and

1415
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:18,900
those that were responsible for
it. But we have a lot of work

1416
01:31:18,990 --> 01:31:24,450
that must still be done in the
area of terrorism in the same

1417
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:28,980
area of the world where al
Baghdadi Baghdadi was

1418
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:36,060
in our own nation. They're your
slaves with the mac and cheese

1419
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:41,580
macaroni and cheese melted
together mac and cheese mac and

1420
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:42,930
cheese mac and cheese.

1421
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:48,270
There you go. Matt thank you
very much for your courage. On

1422
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:48,720
word with

1423
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:56,010
Jenny Jenny Jenny j Naples
Massey in Arvada, Colorado $588

1424
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:59,670
and 90 cents. And she sent a PDF
file of all things.

1425
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:04,410
Letter of explanation to bat
coin.

1426
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,540
I tried emailing an image that I
took. I took it was a coin I

1427
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:12,870
found and changing my original
donation mentioning the bat coin

1428
01:32:12,870 --> 01:32:15,510
on your show back in June but it
must not have gone through as

1429
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:20,190
Adam properly debunked the coin.
So to clarify, this quarter has

1430
01:32:20,190 --> 01:32:24,390
actually been in circulation all
year. Yes, I was incorrect. And

1431
01:32:24,390 --> 01:32:29,550
I believe I stated such well I
don't believe you did because I

1432
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:33,720
didn't I don't remember any of
this. Yeah, I think I remember

1433
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:37,110
being quite strong about this as
bullcrap that it was a

1434
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:41,580
commemorative coin. But it's
not. It was an actual quarter.

1435
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:46,500
That was minted with the bat.
With a bat. Yeah. With the

1436
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:51,210
baseball bat. No a bat as in a
Wu Han flu bat. What was the

1437
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:51,720
point?

1438
01:32:53,130 --> 01:32:56,130
Well, there's a vampire coin.
I'm not getting that it's Yeah,

1439
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:59,490
it was it was okay. There was a
quarter that people were finding

1440
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:05,310
a 25 uS 25 cent quarter that had
a bat on the on one side. You

1441
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:08,160
know this Really? Yes. Is it a
collectible?

1442
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:09,780
Oh,

1443
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:14,880
by the way I am and I like coins
I keep going about this. I

1444
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,180
can't.

1445
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:20,130
Okay, here it is. A quarter with
a bet on it will be this is from

1446
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:22,440
Cincinnati will be minted in the
new year. It's part of the

1447
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:25,650
United States Mint America the
Beautiful quarters program which

1448
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:29,460
honors national parks and other
national sites across the Texas

1449
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:30,150
that

1450
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:35,160
impossibly Yeah, I think so.
Yeah. Yeah, I think and now I

1451
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:36,960
started to remember I think they
had something to do with San

1452
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:41,100
Antonio, Texas. Well, Austin is
the we've got the bat bridge. I

1453
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:44,280
thought the San Antonio had more
bats than Austin. It's actually

1454
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:47,100
it's so creepy. If you look at
this because I'm looking at a

1455
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:50,610
blow up of it. It's two bats one
is hanging upside down has a

1456
01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:54,510
baby bat in it's Tony Hawk. It's
super creepy.

1457
01:33:55,650 --> 01:34:00,030
So she sent them in the Pio box
if I want one I def I never got

1458
01:34:00,030 --> 01:34:05,130
it back. Sorry. I remember
something like this. I think it

1459
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:08,610
is It was so long ago. I just
bet she says to settle the mail

1460
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:11,940
that prove a quarter each of you
I hope he was hoping to package

1461
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:14,340
your eyes you for the show.
Well, I didn't. I have seen the

1462
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:17,100
coins coming through. If I see
it. I'll put it aside for you.

1463
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:20,580
As I own a restaurant in Denver,
it took a little while for one

1464
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:23,400
of the coins to come through my
restaurants cash deposits. It

1465
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:27,210
was great, random fun for my
marriage. As we looked to the

1466
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:31,140
two coins we mailed to you both
couples that no agenda together

1467
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:33,840
do indeed stay together.
Apparently, thanks for the bad

1468
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,260
coin. We look forward to every
show and often find ourselves

1469
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:40,860
quoting the clips randomly to
friends that time. Like it's

1470
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:45,720
true with no explanation except
it's a good one. No explanation.

1471
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:49,800
Just do it. I tell you but I'd
have to hit you in the mouse.

1472
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:52,650
Most of the time. They're
intrigued and we have grown our

1473
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:55,590
no agenda community within our
friend and family circles.

1474
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:58,620
That's a plus. A lot of people
can't manage that. No agenda has

1475
01:34:58,620 --> 01:34:59,970
kept me sane through all this.

1476
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,780
insanity the value is far more
than I can afford to send today.

1477
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:07,530
But this amount brings me to
Dame hood. County attached nice

1478
01:35:07,530 --> 01:35:12,420
if available. I would love to be
known as Dame Valentine of the

1479
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:15,660
bluebird powder region. I think
she's on the list, isn't she?

1480
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:19,770
Yes, she is. Thank you for your
courage gentlemen and john, stay

1481
01:35:19,770 --> 01:35:24,150
safe. A little goat karma for my
restaurant would be greatly

1482
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:25,950
appreciated with gratitude.

1483
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:31,770
Karma

1484
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:35,850
I'm gonna just get her did I?
What did she want at the

1485
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:40,500
roundtable? I'm sorry, I missed
that. Oh, yeah, I have the PDF.

1486
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:45,360
I just have to open it up again.
I have to I can get it back.

1487
01:35:46,530 --> 01:35:49,890
You can county attached you can
go No, nothing. Nothing. Okay,

1488
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,650
go ahead and read the next one.
We're all good.

1489
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:58,050
Okay, oh, Dave fukase. Oh, Duke
of America's Heartland and the

1490
01:35:58,050 --> 01:36:02,580
Arabian Peninsula is back. Nice.
Hello. But is he back? I don't

1491
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:05,280
think he's back. I don't think
he's back from Asia is back on

1492
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:09,600
the list. Poor guy 390 30
Gladstone, Missouri.

1493
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,310
He should go to neon while

1495
01:36:19,470 --> 01:36:22,620

1499
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:37,230
for him. Oh, you should go see
those guys. He should he should

1500
01:36:37,230 --> 01:36:40,350
go to the horrible the guy's
been locked up. He can't leave.

1501
01:36:41,010 --> 01:36:44,100
He's there he might have to go
check stuff out. True.

1502
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:47,550
I have a clip I want to play

1503
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:51,300
it This is how important it is
to go see me I'm

1504
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:55,050
just play this addition before
us because Oh, nice to hear

1505
01:36:55,050 --> 01:36:57,090
this. This is the neon rundown.

1506
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:03,870
Oh, there it is. Neon will be
massive, over 10,000 square

1507
01:37:03,870 --> 01:37:07,980
miles or over 26,000 square
kilometers that will make it

1508
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:09,180
more than 33

1509
01:37:10,230 --> 01:37:13,620
times larger than New York City
and a little less than the size

1510
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:17,130
of Massachusetts located in the
northwest corner of Saudi

1511
01:37:17,130 --> 01:37:21,180
Arabia. Neon loosely connects
the three continents of Africa

1512
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:24,840
Asia and Europe and hopes to be
a leading global hub

1513
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,540
neon size of massive a city the
size of Massachusetts and we

1514
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:34,320
invest in neon yellow Yeah,
isn't a strategy kidding.

1515
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:39,870
I need to exit exit this earth
we need to go to neon neon Neon

1516
01:37:39,870 --> 01:37:42,210
is the place why I put that in
there because there's the code

1517
01:37:42,210 --> 01:37:46,230
word in there and 33 and so it
was nice to get that message he

1518
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:48,450
knows what's up that's a
squirrel nest going on. He

1519
01:37:48,450 --> 01:37:52,260
writes on it the company
recently with details to follow

1520
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:55,050
as things start to settle out
suffice it to say I respectfully

1521
01:37:55,290 --> 01:38:00,540
respectfully suggest the TPP
jobs karma with a deliberate aim

1522
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:04,020
in my general direction you got
it. It's also time to once again

1523
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:08,520
celebrate my end day Melody's
nuptials 17 years and we never

1524
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:11,580
had a fight. That's because you
haven't been together for but

1525
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:12,540
maybe Yeah.

1526
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:18,420
How could you fight? Just Dame
Isabella's 12th birthday? I

1527
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:21,780
guess you got together for that
milestones that at last I'll

1528
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:26,790
celebrate with them from afar as
usual Ah, of course. Such a

1529
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:30,390
suspicious happenings are made
all the better with a tooth of

1530
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:34,470
the official no agenda
celebration horn Hello, and some

1531
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:38,850
terrible terrier karma. Okay,
well we can always toot the horn

1532
01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:43,260
for you. Congratulations much
love from the kingdom yes and

1533
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:47,040
much love from us and from no
agenda nation for your 17 years

1534
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:47,520
together

1535
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:55,530
I didn't mean that

1536
01:38:58,170 --> 01:39:01,740
that's not what he was looking
for. I gave him a dog karma that

1537
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:03,300
was not the idea. This is what
he needs.

1538
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:10,740
Karma That's better.

1539
01:39:11,790 --> 01:39:14,220
Now you got a double man and
that was definitely directed in

1540
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:17,790
you. Now you've got the next
one. And this brings up an

1541
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:23,220
interesting point is shortfall
this today. Okay. We have no

1542
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:26,640
associate executive producers.
It is an interesting thing.

1543
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:31,620
And this is our last for the
segment Baron dirty dick banks

1544
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:35,700
who is in Washington DC. And he
says congrats on 1301 figured

1545
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:38,940
that might be a letdown after
1300. Yeah, well, there's no

1546
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:43,800
associates wide open. Hello,
Dana. A few things. One, my

1547
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:47,130
tired and true method of sending
john a wine order or wine label

1548
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:49,830
and getting insight on wine has
failed.

1549
01:39:51,030 --> 01:39:54,960
This is bad because I think
everyone I know

1550
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,970
feels that they can text you
john at any time of the day.

1551
01:40:00,810 --> 01:40:04,560
If there's a picture of a wine
bottle or a list, you will reply

1552
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:08,460
so I'm surprised I'm there a
surprise this failed. So he goes

1553
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:13,500
on to dirty dirty big banks
recently bought a 2015. Bordeaux

1554
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:19,620
case or two. Which is wrong. You
want the 2016 No, 2015 is great.

1555
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:22,950
Okay, my honey Sorry, I was
unbelievable. I was out looking

1556
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:26,880
for 2016 I didn't know 2020
here's the reason I'll say it

1557
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,940
again. I said it before in the
show. You can pick it you can

1558
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:33,930
throw a dart at 2016 Bordeaux
and it's going to be a winner.

1559
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:38,730
Okay. 2015 Bordeaux's, that is a
great year, but only there's a

1560
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:43,050
couple of areas where it's
spotty. Hmm, well, that's the

1561
01:40:43,050 --> 01:40:46,830
difference. He says he recently
bought a 2015 Bordeaux case or

1562
01:40:46,830 --> 01:40:51,090
two. And then he says you need
to check your email. That to

1563
01:40:51,090 --> 01:40:54,720
celebrate my oldest son's birth
year more on him in a second.

1564
01:40:54,990 --> 01:40:59,340
We'd love 2017 and 19 Bordeaux
recommendations to celebrate my

1565
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:02,550
other two boys birth years. I'll
continue while you think about

1566
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:07,080
that, too. Thank you I get the
sanity you provide myself with a

1567
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:09,990
no agenda chief hater officer,
my smokin hot wife who will

1568
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:12,690
never listen to the show because
of her corrupted feminist view.

1569
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:15,780
This is a marriage made in
heaven are available to keep

1570
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:18,630
things relatively normal for our
three boys in difficult times

1571
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:21,480
the fact base statistics and
sensible approaches to living

1572
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:24,840
life you've provided on the
show, which I then in turn spoon

1573
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:29,190
feed to her unbeknownst to the
NA source. Allow us to avoid the

1574
01:41:29,190 --> 01:41:33,810
amygdala enlargement hysteria
for this antidote to the stereo.

1575
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:37,980
I thank you. My oldest son,
Barrett, Alexander bangs, who

1576
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:40,800
was probably screaming as I play
this in the car because we're

1577
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:45,210
not playing his favorite Disney
songs. Turns five on Monday 12

1578
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:50,010
seven. It's small, small world
you feel better now? Barrett,

1579
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:54,150
you are my nugget. I love you.
And I'm so proud of you. Poor

1580
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:57,270
Barrett's grandparents, who are
my folks and his uncle and aunt,

1581
01:41:57,270 --> 01:42:00,600
my brother and his wife have all
will have punted on Barrett's

1582
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:05,010
birthday due to the hysteria
libtards. The irony, my parents

1583
01:42:05,010 --> 01:42:08,100
both already had COVID and as I
saw on a recent Wall Street

1584
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:12,690
Journal, a whopping 54 of 200
million cases worldwide have

1585
01:42:12,690 --> 01:42:16,620
gotten it twice. Hopefully
they're spending my entire shit

1586
01:42:16,650 --> 01:42:21,030
hopefully. Hopefully, they're
spending my entire inheritance

1587
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:25,290
on the lottery as we speak.
Since they're so Special shout

1588
01:42:25,290 --> 01:42:28,410
outs to Archer Campbell bangs
age three and Colton Reed banks

1589
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:30,870
18 months both probably
screaming as well currently

1590
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:33,480
since we aren't playing their
Disney songs either. Love you

1591
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,760
both and thanks for being such
good little brothers too big

1592
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:39,060
brother Barrett. Could use big
sales karma to close out the

1593
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:41,250
year and health karma first
doctor's appointment in two

1594
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:44,730
years on Monday. I wish I was in
bed but alas after traveling to

1595
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:47,670
Disney for Thanksgiving. This is
the problem with your family.

1596
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:51,300
You've got to cut back on the
Disney mind control for these

1597
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:56,340
children. Please I beg of you.
Look up the Wizard of Oz.

1598
01:42:57,870 --> 01:43:00,840
After traveling to Disney for
Thanksgiving, the boys school is

1599
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,190
required. Sorry.

1600
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:06,420
The Wizard of Oz not a Disney
product. Yeah, but that's where

1601
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:07,020
it all started.

1602
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:12,150
Okay, all right. You're right.
Look at Christina Aguilera. Nuff

1603
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:16,620
said look at Britney Spears.
Nuff said. So we hear we'll dam

1604
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:19,500
as the boy school is requiring
buys the fastest of Montgomery

1605
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:21,780
County, Maryland, which I used
to live in montgomery county.

1606
01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:24,930
That's where I where I was for a
few years after we came back

1607
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:28,350
from Africa to get zivkovic
testing papers prior to them

1608
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:31,380
coming back. So we all got
tested negative and I got a

1609
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:34,320
sinus infection from the test.
Well that you got to get a

1610
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:38,880
dirty, yes, dirty swab baby.
They infected you.

1611
01:43:41,010 --> 01:43:44,310
That we're gonna say john, well,
yeah, I was gonna say that or

1612
01:43:44,310 --> 01:43:46,170
they pee on the swab in some
areas.

1613
01:43:47,730 --> 01:43:51,060
And which would that be in the
DC area or montgomery county

1614
01:43:51,810 --> 01:43:54,780
area the PC area apparently.

1615
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:59,760
We have several regularly tested
frontline workers as friends and

1616
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,910
family and this is a common side
effect. So while I should be in

1617
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:06,240
bed, my head is blasting with
sinus pressure side note. Pretty

1618
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,910
sure I got COVID last Christmas.
It's been here longer than any

1619
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:11,010
of us realize. Thank you for all
you do. It's truly it's

1620
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:14,610
priceless, barren, dirty dig
bags of dcps. I'm an Eagle Scout

1621
01:44:14,610 --> 01:44:17,940
fairly remarkable how many
listeners are and like most

1622
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:19,230
Eagle Scout listeners.

1623
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:22,380
My listeners he

1624
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:27,210
like most Eagle Scout listeners,
my kids won't set foot in the

1625
01:44:27,210 --> 01:44:30,540
Boy Scouts sad the corruption of
such a wonderful organization.

1626
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:33,810
I'm also Jesuit educated, I'd be
willing to bet there's also a

1627
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:37,380
larger cut that's also a larger
cohort of your listeners. Yes, I

1628
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:39,900
think that's true, including Dr.
Anthony Fauci.

1629
01:44:41,610 --> 01:44:45,750
So thank you very much. We do
have some some health karma and

1630
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:47,940
I'm going to throw in a little
bit of goat there for you in the

1631
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:49,500
bank family. You've got

1632
01:44:51,090 --> 01:44:51,570
karma

1633
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:59,130
Now why did you see 199 99

1634
01:45:00,810 --> 01:45:05,340
Do we want to push that one
person up as no such person

1635
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:08,550
specifically said we'll read his
note. Actually since we don't

1636
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:11,370
we're short. We're short
Missouri is no this is Dana.

1637
01:45:11,370 --> 01:45:15,000
This is our the Hollywood or
Hollywood producer celebrity.

1638
01:45:15,150 --> 01:45:17,610
Yeah. Dana Brunetti known from

1639
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:20,160
social

1640
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:25,920
is good enough and and and and
50 Shades of Grey 50 Shades of

1641
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,190
Grey 150 shades of grey shade
you've ever seen. He's more

1642
01:45:29,190 --> 01:45:31,920
embarrassed by that except his
banker. Yeah, he's not

1643
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:35,070
embarrassed by that at all this
state of Jesus in the state of

1644
01:45:35,070 --> 01:45:39,720
Jefferson he claims Oh, sorry
for the 199 99 but I have to

1645
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:43,500
avoid the Associate Producer
credits. They hurt my standing

1646
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:44,610
in the industry.

1647
01:45:45,990 --> 01:45:48,840
He says if I have any left

1648
01:45:49,890 --> 01:45:53,310
Hollywood Yes, my IMDB page
however happened to report the

1649
01:45:53,310 --> 01:45:58,470
karma works ironically, I just
sold the show to IMDb TV. Oh,

1650
01:45:58,470 --> 01:46:02,940
there you go. The karma works.
Also the rainstick works Yeah,

1651
01:46:02,970 --> 01:46:06,300
so we got a storm here and a
tree fell on the awning of my

1652
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:08,460
Airstream and it destroyed it.

1653
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:13,320
To be fair to be fair, the
awnings on the air streams are

1654
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:16,590
pieces of crap to confirm

1655
01:46:17,850 --> 01:46:20,790
their crappy john turn your
speaker's down and stop clicking

1656
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:26,190
your pin. Anyway, I'm gonna go
tasting with him on Monday. Oh,

1657
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:28,860
you're gonna go and what are you
going to be tasting? We're going

1658
01:46:28,860 --> 01:46:34,470
to vary Kay. That's the name of
it very a very it's a very it's

1659
01:46:34,470 --> 01:46:39,810
a very tag. What is very a is
that a winery up in this Edward

1660
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:42,240
Sonoma County winery in the
northern part is an Alexander

1661
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:47,040
Valley. This is one of the
probably four super high end

1662
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:48,780
called wineries that is

1663
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,460
unlike the other ones, this one
is a little more problem. I'm

1664
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:56,400
guessing because I haven't been
to the to the other ones.

1665
01:46:57,930 --> 01:47:01,530
Very, very slick.

1666
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:06,360
Are you do you have to be very
tame if you go to Verity. Yes,

1667
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:11,910
yes. I have to say yes. Doubt
Tell me in your just Verity

1668
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:15,450
voice about the 2015 Bordeaux
recommendation that no What did

1669
01:47:15,450 --> 01:47:19,170
he want Deke? Bang. So I said we
get back he wants 2017 and 2019.

1670
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:21,660
Um, I have to send them a note
on this. Okay. 2017 is the

1671
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:24,510
sketchy year in Bordeaux. And I
think it's generally not good.

1672
01:47:24,870 --> 01:47:27,300
But there's good wines that come
out of it. Like they're new, but

1673
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:30,540
they're all high end. So you
have to buy an expensive wine

1674
01:47:30,540 --> 01:47:33,780
for 2017 if you want to hold up.
Otherwise, there's not like you

1675
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:38,130
can go through the dark like you
can with 2016 2018 and 19 have

1676
01:47:38,130 --> 01:47:41,370
not really hit the market yet.
But both of them look like

1677
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:46,410
killer years. Which is better of
the two. I think they're both

1678
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:48,480
going to be great, but I don't
know which was the throw the

1679
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:53,010
dart year but 2019 I'm guessing
it just you can probably just

1680
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:55,800
pick anything out it's going to
be good but you want to pick for

1681
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:59,670
kids because you want to wind
the last at least 21 years. You

1682
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:01,440
do with it? Is that a thing?

1683
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:07,950
Well, Bordeaux is in a good year
last 50 years but 21 years is

1684
01:48:07,950 --> 01:48:10,440
what you want because the
kitchen has some wine is wine

1685
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:11,010
year when he's

1686
01:48:12,450 --> 01:48:16,800
birthday is so cute as hell
there's wine and you know it's

1687
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:22,830
this kind of kind of charming.
Oh yeah, super super. Well it is

1688
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:23,640
to wine drinker.

1689
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:26,850
Anyway, we were at the
restaurant last night I

1690
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,940
specifically look for a 2016
Bordeaux there wasn't a Bordeaux

1691
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:32,070
on the list. Oh

1692
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:36,480
outrage it's an outrage or maybe
it was Bordeaux and had some

1693
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:36,870
friends

1694
01:48:38,070 --> 01:48:40,530
of yours over generalized wine
tip because I've always seen

1695
01:48:40,530 --> 01:48:42,600
them once a second hold on a
second

1696
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:48,840
generalized wine tip you go to
you go to a restaurant you don't

1697
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:51,690
know anything. And you know you
got to sell me a and if he

1698
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:55,050
really somebody is are no good
unless you know how to talk to

1699
01:48:55,050 --> 01:48:57,270
them. And that means you better
know something. So this

1700
01:48:57,270 --> 01:49:00,090
otherwise are just bullshit. But
if you know we're gonna be

1701
01:49:00,090 --> 01:49:02,850
talking about you're gonna give
us some phrases to use so we can

1702
01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:06,660
impress them. Now I'm just gonna
give you a wine to pick okay?

1703
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:10,380
Because if this wine is on any
wine list, and it's on most wine

1704
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:13,530
list, because they need these
alternative cheap wines that are

1705
01:49:13,530 --> 01:49:16,500
good. And this is a cheap wine
that's good.

1706
01:49:18,210 --> 01:49:21,000
Outside of a Beaujolais was
usually if there's emotionally

1707
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,340
and they'll that you can talk to
the sommelier, and they'll tell

1708
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:28,980
you which one might be the best.
But look for a G gone does g big

1709
01:49:29,010 --> 01:49:34,680
g gone? GOND a s is a Rhone
Valley wine is a recent

1710
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:38,280
appellation, I think from maybe
20 years ago or so. It's always

1711
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:43,320
dynamite. I don't care what year
it is. If it's on the wine list,

1712
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:46,830
I guarantee I picked it up for a
reason because it's good tasting

1713
01:49:47,310 --> 01:49:51,600
cheap. So if relatively cheap,
can I ask a question Would it be

1714
01:49:51,630 --> 01:49:54,810
then if I'm in the restaurant,
can I say something like do you

1715
01:49:54,810 --> 01:49:58,200
have a gigondas or something
like that? When you sound like

1716
01:49:58,200 --> 01:49:59,760
at least sound like a loser?
Okay.

1717
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:03,119
Don't do that.

1718
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:06,450
I will refrain. You got it.

1719
01:50:07,529 --> 01:50:11,069
And thank you to our executive
producers exclusively today.

1720
01:50:11,099 --> 01:50:13,409
That has not happened a long
time that we haven't had an

1721
01:50:13,409 --> 01:50:16,529
associate executive producer. I
don't even know if that's ever

1722
01:50:16,529 --> 01:50:20,279
happened. It's usually the other
way around. Oh, yeah. we

1723
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:25,860
bump a guy. Yeah. No, no one got
bumped. He's all he's all bummed

1724
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:29,070
down. Yeah, no, it gets bumped
down. So we just don't have one.

1725
01:50:29,070 --> 01:50:31,860
That's the way it is. Well, we
are highly beginning of the end

1726
01:50:31,890 --> 01:50:32,940
highly appreciate

1727
01:50:34,290 --> 01:50:36,510
that. That's your build back
better, baby. That's how it

1728
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:40,830
rolls Joe's coming in shows
going down. We highly appreciate

1729
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:43,320
the support that we receive from
these executive producers. And

1730
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:45,180
we do have more producers who
have certainly supported the

1731
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:47,160
show. We'll talk about them,
we'll thank them in our second

1732
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:50,340
segment. We do need your help,
especially from your associate

1733
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:54,840
executives out there. And you
know, apparently Hollywood has

1734
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:58,380
given up on us because they've
been shamed, shamed for

1735
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:01,590
promoting the show. Shame for
benign promoting Same for

1736
01:51:01,590 --> 01:51:06,660
producing it. IMDb shame Oh, by
the way, you know, he says he

1737
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:10,530
got a gig at IMDb TV and I'm
looking I said what is that you

1738
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:14,820
know what it is? Yes, I think I
looked it up it's Did you know

1739
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:19,200
that i AMD was purchased by
Amazon yes that's Amazon TV.

1740
01:51:19,230 --> 01:51:21,480
That's right. I didn't know this
because I looked at oh this is

1741
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:25,740
like I am b d TV whatever it is
just like some sort of an Amazon

1742
01:51:25,890 --> 01:51:30,600
second channel what would you be
more ashamed of saying that yes

1743
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:31,560
produce agree with

1744
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:35,700
agree that you produce the no
agenda show you produced a show

1745
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:41,580
for Amazon. But no, it's not.
Amazon is IMD BMT. But that's

1746
01:51:41,610 --> 01:51:45,600
but that's the head fake because
it's an IMDb TV. Yeah, it's a

1747
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:47,340
Jeff Bezos property.

1748
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:53,100
Yeah, that's what I okay. So the
he has to live with it.

1749
01:51:54,990 --> 01:51:58,320
You have to live with your
choices young man should decide.

1750
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:02,580
And again, thank you. This is
exactly how we treat our top

1751
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:05,970
donors. And somehow they like
it. I'm not quite sure how that

1752
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:08,850
works. But we've been doing it
for a while. And we'd love to do

1753
01:52:08,850 --> 01:52:12,090
it again. With your help on the
show coming up in just a couple

1754
01:52:12,090 --> 01:52:15,300
of days will be Thursday. And we
are getting closer to all kinds

1755
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,580
of fun deadlines. So there's
certainly be stuff to

1756
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:21,540
deconstruct. Please, please help
us support the show by going to

1757
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:26,340
devora.org slash and that's
really all I asked for is your

1758
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:28,560
time your talent or your
treasure and thank you for

1759
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:33,690
producing the show. Our formula
is this. We go out. We hit

1760
01:52:33,690 --> 01:52:34,440
people in the mouth.

1761
01:52:50,790 --> 01:52:51,780
little animal.

1762
01:52:52,830 --> 01:52:57,270
A little entre mom before we get
into other stuff. A win a win

1763
01:52:57,270 --> 01:53:04,200
for sane pneus a win for people
like myself, who are sick and

1764
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:11,250
tired of lying scumbag fellow
travelers. Ha ha ha ha ha suck

1765
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:14,490
it well, can I there's a new
rule for airline passengers no

1766
01:53:14,490 --> 01:53:17,850
more emotional support animals.
Next year the only service

1767
01:53:17,850 --> 01:53:20,760
animals allowed on planes will
be dogs specifically trained to

1768
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:24,120
help people with disabilities
that rules out cats and exotic

1769
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:29,040
pets including Yes, turkeys and
peacocks. Dogs

1770
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:35,670
finally, finally, finally
finally and you will be

1771
01:53:35,670 --> 01:53:41,340
required. If the dog is for
psychiatric purposes you will be

1772
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:45,120
required. Regardless Actually, I
don't think you can be required

1773
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:48,150
to show why you have a service
dog but you will have to show

1774
01:53:48,450 --> 01:53:53,640
the true service dog papers not
some phony baloney saddle you

1775
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:58,230
threw on your poodle that says
emotional support and the mo

1776
01:53:58,590 --> 01:54:05,250
haha suck it you pussies so sick
and tired of these liar that was

1777
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:09,390
out of control. I was lying
they're liars. Oh and they get

1778
01:54:09,390 --> 01:54:12,150
too bored first with their lying
dogs.

1779
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:19,500
So that's over. Thank you that
really trying to squeeze every

1780
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:22,650
dime they can out of passengers
now they need people to pay for

1781
01:54:22,650 --> 01:54:24,900
their pets and they got no
money.

1782
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:32,340
So I have a couple of little
side projects here a little side

1783
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:37,530
reports Okay, from NBC This is
apparent what's coming up as

1784
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:41,550
package get in package you're
getting this package package

1785
01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:45,240
you're getting yeah package
you're getting okay because all

1786
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:47,070
these stores everything's all
the shops are closed so

1787
01:54:47,070 --> 01:54:50,760
everyone's ordering online and
so now there's the delivery

1788
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:53,550
services can handle it so it's a
package get in.

1789
01:54:55,050 --> 01:54:59,370
So I picked up this very short
clips on NBC did a whole 10

1790
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:00,000
minutes on it.

1791
01:55:00,539 --> 01:55:06,269
But I get this this I found this
to be peculiar This is package

1792
01:55:06,299 --> 01:55:11,429
Gedan with odd reporter NBC,
okay.

1793
01:55:12,570 --> 01:55:15,690
The holiday delivery crushes on
with a staggering number of

1794
01:55:15,690 --> 01:55:19,800
packages by Christmas companies
are now taking extreme measures

1795
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:24,180
and the new deadlines for gift
delivery Julian cat has details

1796
01:55:24,870 --> 01:55:28,440
with Christmas around the corner
the shipping rush is on. And

1797
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:33,150
experts say this year there will
be 250 million more packages

1798
01:55:33,330 --> 01:55:39,090
than delivery systems can
handle. We will be having 3

1799
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:43,230
billion packages to be delivered
between Thanksgiving and

1800
01:55:43,230 --> 01:55:47,820
Christmas and that is not
counting the millions of

1801
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:53,280
packages that will come starting
middle of next week for COVID-19

1802
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:53,790
vaccines.

1803
01:55:56,460 --> 01:56:00,930
That's weird that doesn't sound
writing this indian guy in an

1804
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:05,190
echo chamber because it sounds
like there's some science to it

1805
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:09,240
you do the sounds like he's in
the sound This is more of the

1806
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:12,420
reporting there's this the best
NBC can do is find this guy this

1807
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:15,990
Indian who sounds like he's
calling you about you know

1808
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:20,970
mariadb special offer or the IRS
disaster you know, the IRS is

1809
01:56:20,970 --> 01:56:23,190
after you or your social
security number has been

1810
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:26,220
compromised. So they bring this
guy in

1811
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:27,690
as a

1812
01:56:28,710 --> 01:56:32,190
loot. And so I thought this was
idiotic and so then they go to

1813
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:34,920
the end of the report with this
is packaged get an odd voice

1814
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:39,660
drop. Now they they put him in
as a punch line in another in

1815
01:56:39,690 --> 01:56:42,750
the later part of the report
once you play this because if

1816
01:56:42,750 --> 01:56:45,930
you leave your shopping to the
last minute but look destiny

1817
01:56:45,930 --> 01:56:51,060
thing for your orders this year
is going to be very expensive.

1818
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:56,040
shipping fees will only
increase. Okay, let me just the

1819
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:58,830
first thing I observed is he's
talking about because COVID

1820
01:56:58,830 --> 01:57:01,290
vaccine that's not being mailed

1821
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:06,660
that's that's supposed to be
distributed by Yeah, that's true

1822
01:57:06,690 --> 01:57:07,890
operation works.

1823
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:14,550
But the way what is NBC up to
that they have to use this guy

1824
01:57:14,550 --> 01:57:18,030
in a in a he's in a closet or in
a bucket. I mean, it's just

1825
01:57:18,180 --> 01:57:22,050
lame. I've got an example later
in the show some very poor

1826
01:57:22,050 --> 01:57:25,830
Editing by NBC is really
dropping the ball here. But I

1827
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:28,410
don't think this report was
about shipper getting or

1828
01:57:28,410 --> 01:57:32,550
anything else. I think it was
about this native ad part. Right

1829
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:36,960
in the middle of the of the of
the package getting report is

1830
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:40,530
this little native ad right in
the middle listen to this

1831
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:44,130
instacart now offering same day
delivery for major brands, like

1832
01:57:44,130 --> 01:57:47,760
the Disney Store, Bed Bath and
Beyond Sephora and more.

1833
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:53,160
me hear that again. instacart.
Now offering same day delivery

1834
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:56,010
for major brands, like the
Disney Store, Bed Bath and

1835
01:57:56,010 --> 01:57:58,050
Beyond Sephora and more.

1836
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:04,440
What's the point of that? Oh,
that's totally a native ad. For

1837
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:08,190
instance, they charge disney
store X amount of money just to

1838
01:58:08,190 --> 01:58:09,630
be mentioned in the report.

1839
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:12,570
I'd like to know what the fee
was.

1840
01:58:14,190 --> 01:58:16,800
No, I really don't care. Doesn't
matter who's watching that the

1841
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:19,620
only person watching is you and
it's not working on you. So

1842
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:25,710
the President was I'm gonna
transition real fast away from

1843
01:58:25,710 --> 01:58:31,200
that. The President was in
Georgia yesterday. And yeah, and

1844
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:32,610
he had a big rally

1845
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:38,580
with a lot of mega nation very
excited to have him there. And

1846
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:44,310
he was relaxed and chilled. And
he was cracking jokes.

1847
01:58:45,900 --> 01:58:50,760
It was he was a very relaxed
guy. The first lady came out and

1848
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:56,220
had dynamite. Did I say
dynamite? Maroon red leather

1849
01:58:56,220 --> 01:59:01,320
coat? Oh my god. That was a
great she looks fantastic. She

1850
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:03,990
almost winged it without the
prompter. got through most of it

1851
01:59:03,990 --> 01:59:08,280
pretty well. And here's just a
quick couple of sound bites and

1852
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:11,610
cucumbers who grow does
cucumbers around here. Because I

1853
01:59:11,610 --> 01:59:15,780
like cucumbers, can you I'm the
only one. I like you. You can

1854
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:20,220
tell he's back to his old self.
He's He's relaxed. He's chatting

1855
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:23,280
about cucumbers. It really
doesn't matter too much.

1856
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:27,960
Everything seems to be pretty
good. He does see something that

1857
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:32,340
we've noticed as well. And this
issue is all go awry in Georgia

1858
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:35,580
with the with the vote counts.
And if it turns out that there

1859
01:59:35,580 --> 01:59:39,180
was some Hanky Panky business
going on, according to mo facts

1860
01:59:39,210 --> 01:59:43,440
that Stacey Abrams would be left
holding the bag and the

1861
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:47,190
president called her out. And
whatever reason your secretary

1862
01:59:47,190 --> 01:59:51,150
of state and your governor are
afraid of Stacey Abrams, they're

1863
01:59:51,150 --> 01:59:51,540
afraid.

1864
01:59:57,090 --> 01:59:59,550
So he's amping up everything on

1865
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,250
What's happening in Georgia.
Now,

1866
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:06,690
if you're interested in want to
dive deep into all of the

1867
02:00:06,690 --> 02:00:09,480
mounting evidence regarding

1868
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:14,190
election fraud and can save
voter fraud, but I think

1869
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:18,060
election fraud is more accurate,
and there and which lawsuits and

1870
02:00:18,060 --> 02:00:22,290
there's new lawsuits going in
continuously. Ted Cruz is now

1871
02:00:22,290 --> 02:00:26,130
involved. I find this very
amusing. Ted Cruz is going to

1872
02:00:26,130 --> 02:00:31,680
the Supreme Court on behalf of
the people. I know for the

1873
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:36,720
people of Pennsylvania, but I'm
on behalf of the people. As he

1874
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:40,740
feels that there's a catch 22
somehow that goes into the

1875
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:44,850
latches act as to when you can
when you do or do not have

1876
02:00:44,850 --> 02:00:48,420
standing to bring a lawsuit, and
that you in an election, you

1877
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:52,860
basically can't win. Because if
the election isn't dead, all the

1878
02:00:52,860 --> 02:00:55,350
counting is done. You don't have
standing because there's no

1879
02:00:55,350 --> 02:00:58,380
crime being committed. And if
you come after the fact and they

1880
02:00:58,380 --> 02:01:01,140
say, well, you should have
mentioned it earlier, so now

1881
02:01:01,140 --> 02:01:04,860
there's no now You're too late.
Ah, yeah, this is it's something

1882
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:09,630
that is constitutionally weird.
And he's going to fight that and

1883
02:01:09,630 --> 02:01:14,430
that could change something in
Pennsylvania, Ted Cruz, for as

1884
02:01:14,430 --> 02:01:17,970
creepy as he can be. He's a good
lawyer and he has been at the

1885
02:01:17,970 --> 02:01:20,910
Supreme Court and he has he has
won stuff at the Supreme Court

1886
02:01:20,910 --> 02:01:23,940
and he was also which always
surprised me when he went up

1887
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:28,800
against Trump because he lost
was Ted Cruz as it was always

1888
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:33,570
the head and apparently a rough
and tumble debater. He was the

1889
02:01:33,570 --> 02:01:38,370
head of the debating society and
like a superstar debater. He was

1890
02:01:38,370 --> 02:01:42,060
a master debater he master
debater. I think we titled The

1891
02:01:42,060 --> 02:01:45,870
show after him once. So I have
three clips that will bring you

1892
02:01:45,870 --> 02:01:49,530
up to speed on what's happening.
I think the easiest is to start

1893
02:01:49,530 --> 02:01:50,850
with the man who

1894
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:55,650
clearly knows exactly what's
going on. He works at CNN, so

1895
02:01:55,650 --> 02:01:58,020
why wouldn't he know what's
happening with the morning

1896
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:01,290
briefing from Jeff Zucker. This
is Jake Tapper. To talk

1897
02:02:01,290 --> 02:02:06,930
specifically about El Cid, the
cracking keeper and Lynwood who

1898
02:02:06,930 --> 02:02:10,380
are filing lawsuit after lawsuit
city power new lawsuit in

1899
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:15,870
Arizona alleging 412,000 illegal
ballots This Just In fact, most

1900
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:18,750
of even Fox I heard yesterday
are going from

1901
02:02:20,940 --> 02:02:26,760
no widespread voter fraud to Wow
What did you open a beer?

1902
02:02:29,370 --> 02:02:32,130
A Miller Lite. Well, then I'll
have to pour it.

1903
02:02:40,470 --> 02:02:44,100
Well, okay, I mean, that's done
didn't work. I got water all

1904
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:47,250
over my pants. Okay, well, I'm
gonna do my own version of it

1905
02:02:47,250 --> 02:02:47,580
here.

1906
02:02:56,910 --> 02:02:58,410
Perfect. No water.

1907
02:03:00,060 --> 02:03:03,030
So there's lots I mean,
interrupt that's go on. I wanted

1908
02:03:03,030 --> 02:03:05,310
to bomb hit anyway. There's lots
of

1909
02:03:08,070 --> 02:03:11,610
elbowed worn up. There's, you
know, General Flynn is now also

1910
02:03:11,610 --> 02:03:14,850
come out. And he's talking and
so there's a lot going on. But

1911
02:03:14,850 --> 02:03:17,340
let's Oh, yeah. That's what I
was saying before is interrupted

1912
02:03:17,490 --> 02:03:20,700
that fox news has gone from
there's no widespread voter

1913
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:23,400
fraud, which mean and everyone
says this, oh, well, that means

1914
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:26,130
there's some some fraud,
election fraud, but it's not

1915
02:03:26,130 --> 02:03:29,790
widespread. And now they've gone
to Well, it's kind of curious

1916
02:03:29,790 --> 02:03:32,490
where things are coming up with.
Unless you're Jake Tapper. This

1917
02:03:32,490 --> 02:03:39,150
is the best this is. This is the
handbook for m five m, how to

1918
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:42,960
marginalize someone who may
actually be right about

1919
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:45,510
something, just do the
following. So pro Trump

1920
02:03:45,510 --> 02:03:50,730
attorneys, Linwood and Sidney
Powell, who constantly push the

1921
02:03:50,730 --> 02:03:54,000
most deranged conspiracy
theories. Because there's,

1922
02:03:54,330 --> 02:03:56,760
there's a spectrum of them that
mean and if you listen to no

1923
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:59,580
agenda show those those cats
aren't anywhere ever compared to

1924
02:03:59,580 --> 02:04:03,390
these guys. They held one of
these stop this steel rallies

1925
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:06,240
this week in Georgia. Again,
this is all based on nonsense,

1926
02:04:06,570 --> 02:04:07,320
and the action.

1927
02:04:08,370 --> 02:04:11,640
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
point of order point of personal

1928
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:18,480
privilege. You cannot say for
weeks, baseless claims, and then

1929
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:23,220
say it's based on nonsense. It's
either baseless or not Jake

1930
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:26,760
Tapper. Again, this is all based
on nonsense. And they actually

1931
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:30,810
were discouraging Georgia
republicans from voting at all

1932
02:04:30,870 --> 02:04:33,180
in the runoffs on January 5.
Take a listen.

1933
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:38,940
I think I would encourage all
Georgians to make it known that

1934
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:43,350
you will not vote at all until
your vote is secure. They have

1935
02:04:43,350 --> 02:04:44,460
not earned your vote.

1936
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:47,040
Don't you give it to them.

1937
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:53,640
Why would you go back in folks
in another rigged election for

1938
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:54,600
God's sakes.

1939
02:04:55,620 --> 02:04:57,630
Now, again, as a factual matter,

1940
02:04:59,100 --> 02:04:59,970
the vote was

1941
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,620
secure and is secure by all
evidence, and it was not rigged.

1942
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:07,140
So what they're saying is not
true.

1943
02:05:09,929 --> 02:05:14,489
There you go, that you know that
that report is so outrageous. I

1944
02:05:14,489 --> 02:05:17,549
have to give you a clip of the
day for that. Well, I appreciate

1945
02:05:17,549 --> 02:05:18,959
that unexpected by the way.

1946
02:05:22,170 --> 02:05:26,730
I have a Buddhist, I have the
NBC version of what you just

1947
02:05:26,730 --> 02:05:30,180
play. We need to hear this. This
is very important, but it's not

1948
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:34,800
as good as that. Well, Jake
Tapper is the big leaks. So it's

1949
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:37,920
beyond but Jake Tapper is really
an opinion guy, not not a news

1950
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:41,400
guy. Here's the news guy. This
weird election report from NBC

1951
02:05:41,430 --> 02:05:45,810
tonight President Trump headed
south, dialing up his pressure

1952
02:05:45,810 --> 02:05:49,500
campaign against Georgia's
republican governor to persuade

1953
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:53,400
the state legislature to
overturn Biden's victory. You

1954
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:56,010
got to make sure your governor
gets a lot tougher than he's

1955
02:05:56,010 --> 02:05:59,490
been because it's taken this
election is control of the US

1956
02:05:59,490 --> 02:06:02,970
Senate. And that really means
control of this country are

1957
02:06:02,970 --> 02:06:07,230
waiting for him in Georgia. Many
Trump supporters echoed the

1958
02:06:07,230 --> 02:06:10,950
President's unfounded claims of
election fraud. I wanted to come

1959
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:13,920
see my president, my next
president for the next four

1960
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:18,840
years. While Mr. Trump's trip is
for Georgia's high stakes senate

1961
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:22,080
run off next month. The
President is fixated on the

1962
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:25,500
November election he lost.
Georgia's ballots have been

1963
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:28,440
recounted twice. But the
President demands a separate

1964
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:33,030
signature check for all voters
today blasting Georgia's top GOP

1965
02:06:33,030 --> 02:06:37,290
leaders. Why are these two
Republicans saying no. aides to

1966
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:40,770
Governor Brian Kemp say the
president phone today. Kim

1967
02:06:40,770 --> 02:06:43,860
tweeted, as I told the president
this morning, I've publicly

1968
02:06:43,860 --> 02:06:47,760
called for a signature audit
three times. The President fired

1969
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:50,940
back but you never got the
signature verification. Your

1970
02:06:50,940 --> 02:06:54,480
people are refusing to do what
you ask. The governor says he

1971
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:57,600
cannot lawfully give President
Trump what he wants.

1972
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:03,780
That was that a whipsaw?

1973
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:06,990
It was the best whipsaw I've
ever heard.

1974
02:07:08,550 --> 02:07:10,170
People refusing to do what

1975
02:07:11,310 --> 02:07:14,280
the governor says he cannot
lawfully give President Trump

1976
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:15,270
what he wants.

1977
02:07:17,790 --> 02:07:21,420
Did you edit that? That's the
way the report No I did not.

1978
02:07:21,540 --> 02:07:21,840
People

1979
02:07:25,410 --> 02:07:29,670
are yelling for more years. What
she's she did the whipsaw works

1980
02:07:29,670 --> 02:07:33,270
like this. She what Trump wants
is the signature recount. Right.

1981
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:37,470
And that's what he wants. Yeah.
And so so they they edit in when

1982
02:07:37,470 --> 02:07:41,610
she says the words give Trump
what he wants, then they have

1983
02:07:41,610 --> 02:07:44,730
these people yelling for more
years, which is also what he

1984
02:07:44,730 --> 02:07:50,070
wants, but it's not part of the
report. So it's like a very

1985
02:07:50,070 --> 02:07:54,660
advanced whipsaw. Yes. I don't
think it's on purpose. I think

1986
02:07:54,660 --> 02:07:55,800
they're just idiots.

1987
02:07:57,030 --> 02:07:59,730
I don't I don't know you say
very advanced, you give them a

1988
02:07:59,730 --> 02:08:04,050
lot of credit. You I'm not going
to make an argument here. Okay.

1989
02:08:04,410 --> 02:08:08,070
But you might be right. But
it's, it's beautiful.

1990
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:12,870
Let's get an update. Oops, let's
get an update from the horse's

1991
02:08:12,870 --> 02:08:16,830
mouth. So to speak from El Cid,
the cracking keeper? Well, the

1992
02:08:16,830 --> 02:08:21,210
11th circuit just rejected our
appeal from the district courts,

1993
02:08:21,210 --> 02:08:25,680
partial grant of relief to us.
And so we'll be back in the

1994
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:29,400
District Court for a hearing.
Hopefully Monday or Tuesday.

1995
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:31,950
We'll see where it goes from
there. But one of the things we

1996
02:08:31,950 --> 02:08:36,570
want and have been trying to get
with great opposition is the

1997
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:40,410
voting machines to be secured
all across the state of Georgia,

1998
02:08:40,620 --> 02:08:43,500
because massive evidence of the
shaping of votes and the

1999
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:47,790
flipping of votes from a Trump
to Biden exists in those

2000
02:08:47,790 --> 02:08:51,090
machines, except to the extent
they've been erasing things and

2001
02:08:51,090 --> 02:08:54,630
destroying evidence as fast as
they can do it. I have in my

2002
02:08:54,630 --> 02:08:59,580
office right now, a huge bag of
shredded ballots. I can't wait

2003
02:08:59,580 --> 02:09:03,420
to see what that discloses. And
they're more on the way where do

2004
02:09:03,420 --> 02:09:06,300
you get the shredded ballots
from who turns those over to

2005
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:10,830
you? citizens are out there,
watching and observing

2006
02:09:10,830 --> 02:09:14,550
everything. The people of
America are not going to allow

2007
02:09:14,550 --> 02:09:18,840
our president to be defeated by
fraudulent election mechanisms.

2008
02:09:19,170 --> 02:09:22,860
And these people have used every
manner in means of voter fraud.

2009
02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:26,520
You can imagine it's was heavily
coordinated, it was heavily

2010
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:30,840
funded. And they now have 25
lawyers or so lined up against

2011
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:37,320
us, our little ragtag team of
misfit toys that are trying to

2012
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:41,700
fight for truth and justice for
the American people. well

2013
02:09:41,700 --> 02:09:46,530
positioned ragtag team. Yeah.
Now, I think she has a lot more

2014
02:09:46,530 --> 02:09:49,050
coming. And we have some time
and I'm going to run through the

2015
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:53,340
constitutional timeline and in a
moment with help from the

2016
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:57,180
representative from Alabama, but
here's my conflict, my personal

2017
02:09:57,180 --> 02:09:59,970
conflict. The show's title is no
agenda.

2018
02:10:00,359 --> 02:10:04,499
I have no agenda. I don't give a
crap about Democrat, Republican

2019
02:10:04,499 --> 02:10:08,519
libertarian. I've never belonged
to any party ever. nor would I,

2020
02:10:08,519 --> 02:10:11,039
I don't like the idea. I'm not
interested in the political

2021
02:10:11,039 --> 02:10:15,809
power. I'm a United States
citizen. And the reason why I'm

2022
02:10:15,839 --> 02:10:20,699
still very interested in this is
because I do believe in stuff

2023
02:10:20,699 --> 02:10:24,449
like this, Samuel Adams said,
the liberties of our country,

2024
02:10:24,449 --> 02:10:27,509
the freedoms of our civil
constitution are worth defending

2025
02:10:27,509 --> 02:10:31,139
at all hazards. It is our duty
to defend them against all

2026
02:10:31,139 --> 02:10:34,469
attacks, we have received them
as a fair inheritance from our

2027
02:10:34,469 --> 02:10:38,939
worthy ancestors, they purchased
them for us with toil and danger

2028
02:10:38,939 --> 02:10:42,389
and expensive treasure and
blood, it will bring a mark of

2029
02:10:42,389 --> 02:10:45,569
everlasting infamy on the
present generation enlightened

2030
02:10:45,569 --> 02:10:49,139
as it is, if we should suffer
them to be rested from us by

2031
02:10:49,139 --> 02:10:52,679
violence without a struggle, or
to be cheated out of them by the

2032
02:10:52,679 --> 02:10:55,739
artifices of designing men.

2033
02:10:57,180 --> 02:10:59,940
So that's why I'm very
interested, if this is rigged,

2034
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:03,750
then we need to make sure it's
unrigged for the midterm and

2035
02:11:03,750 --> 02:11:07,200
unrigged for the next general
election, four years, that's the

2036
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:11,790
most important thing. And it's
not baseless, there's clear

2037
02:11:11,790 --> 02:11:16,170
evidence of election fraud and
some voter fraud are two

2038
02:11:16,170 --> 02:11:20,010
different things. And this will,
and this will go the president

2039
02:11:20,010 --> 02:11:24,180
who has sworn to uphold defend
the Constitution of the United

2040
02:11:24,180 --> 02:11:28,050
States, as has every other House
of Representative member, every

2041
02:11:28,050 --> 02:11:32,970
senator, they have the duty to
see this all the way through,

2042
02:11:32,970 --> 02:11:37,200
and the American people have
been poorly educated and do not

2043
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:42,330
understand the civics of our
constitutional republic. So in

2044
02:11:42,330 --> 02:11:45,870
the next few months, actually, I
should read this first before I

2045
02:11:45,870 --> 02:11:49,320
go to the final thing I'll have
for today. This is the opening

2046
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:54,240
paragraph of executive order on
imposing certain sanctions in

2047
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:56,820
the event of foreign
interference in the United

2048
02:11:56,820 --> 02:12:02,220
States election. And this was
issued on September 12 2018. I,

2049
02:12:02,250 --> 02:12:04,590
Donald J. Trump, president
united states of america find

2050
02:12:04,590 --> 02:12:07,740
that the ability of persons
located in whole or in

2051
02:12:07,740 --> 02:12:11,640
substantial part outside the
United States to interfere in or

2052
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:14,910
undermine public confidence in
the United States elections,

2053
02:12:15,270 --> 02:12:18,480
including through the
unauthorized accessing of

2054
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:21,810
election and campaign
infrastructure, or the covert

2055
02:12:21,810 --> 02:12:25,500
distribution of propaganda and
disinformation constitutes an

2056
02:12:25,530 --> 02:12:29,010
unusual and extraordinary threat
to the national security and

2057
02:12:29,010 --> 02:12:32,340
foreign policy of the United
States. Although there has been

2058
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:35,100
no evidence of a foreign power
altering the outcome or vote

2059
02:12:35,100 --> 02:12:38,580
tabulation and the United States
election, foreign powers have

2060
02:12:38,580 --> 02:12:41,610
historically sought to exploit
America's free and open

2061
02:12:41,610 --> 02:12:44,670
political system. In recent
years, the proliferation of

2062
02:12:44,670 --> 02:12:48,090
digital devices and internet
based communications has created

2063
02:12:48,090 --> 02:12:51,270
significant vulnerabilities and
magnified the scope and

2064
02:12:51,270 --> 02:12:54,180
intensity of the threat of
foreign interference as

2065
02:12:54,180 --> 02:12:58,110
illustrated in the 2017
intelligence community asset, I

2066
02:12:58,110 --> 02:13:01,980
hereby declare a national
emergency to deal with this

2067
02:13:01,980 --> 02:13:05,190
threat. And without going into
this deeper, it's it's alarming

2068
02:13:05,190 --> 02:13:08,700
executive order. It's your duty
almost to read it just to be

2069
02:13:08,700 --> 02:13:12,930
informed. But 45 days after the
conclusion of the United States

2070
02:13:12,930 --> 02:13:15,690
election, the Director of
National Intelligence, in

2071
02:13:15,690 --> 02:13:18,990
consultation with the heads of
any other appropriate executive

2072
02:13:18,990 --> 02:13:22,080
departments shall conduct an
assessment of any information

2073
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:25,320
indicating the foreign
government, or any person acting

2074
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:27,690
as an agent on behalf of foreign
government has acted with the

2075
02:13:27,690 --> 02:13:30,780
intent or purpose of interfering
that election. And it goes on

2076
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:35,220
and on and on. It's almost as if
he knew it was coming. That's

2077
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:40,200
all I'm gonna say. So how do we
get this to the final outcome

2078
02:13:40,230 --> 02:13:43,020
that the President wants? We
will have to go through the

2079
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:46,530
process the Electoral College,
all of this is almost

2080
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:51,990
unnecessary. If you listen to
the timeline of representative

2081
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:55,860
mo Brooks from Alabama, who
explains exactly how this will

2082
02:13:55,860 --> 02:14:00,690
go down on January the sixth at
1pm. Eastern Time, the 50 states

2083
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:05,280
will report to Congress, the
president Senate will preside

2084
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:09,570
over this meeting, will report
to Congress, what they contend

2085
02:14:09,690 --> 02:14:13,260
for the electoral college
results in their state. If a

2086
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:18,630
house member and a senator
objects to the submission of

2087
02:14:18,630 --> 02:14:22,470
electoral college votes by any
state that immediately triggers

2088
02:14:22,710 --> 02:14:26,490
a house floor vote in a Senate
for a vote on whether to accept

2089
02:14:26,490 --> 02:14:29,640
or reject those electoral
college votes submitted by that

2090
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:33,090
particular state. The amount of
debate on the house and senate

2091
02:14:33,090 --> 02:14:37,050
floor is limited to two hours
under federal law. And if we

2092
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:39,900
reject those electoral college
votes, then they're taken out of

2093
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:47,250
the mix. If the election process
problems are so great, that

2094
02:14:47,250 --> 02:14:51,690
after subtracting the electoral
college votes of states that are

2095
02:14:51,690 --> 02:14:58,350
running a poor election system,
the system so suspect that you

2096
02:14:58,350 --> 02:15:00,000
can't give credibility to the

2097
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,460
results that are being reported.
Then,

2098
02:15:03,659 --> 02:15:08,789
the United States Constitution
mandates that Congress determine

2099
02:15:08,789 --> 02:15:12,869
who the next president and vice
president of the United States

2100
02:15:12,869 --> 02:15:16,529
will be under Article One,
Article two and amendment 12.

2101
02:15:16,619 --> 02:15:22,829
United States Constitution, the
house of representatives will be

2102
02:15:22,859 --> 02:15:27,119
the body that determines who is
president knighted states. The

2103
02:15:27,119 --> 02:15:29,789
vice president will be
determined by the United States

2104
02:15:29,789 --> 02:15:32,339
Senate and they can even be
members of different parties, if

2105
02:15:32,339 --> 02:15:36,059
that's the will of the House and
the Senate. Now in the house,

2106
02:15:36,239 --> 02:15:40,049
there's a little bit of a twist.
It's not a majority of 435

2107
02:15:40,049 --> 02:15:43,529
congressmen that determines who
the President knighted states

2108
02:15:43,529 --> 02:15:47,039
will be, whether it is a
majority of the state

2109
02:15:47,039 --> 02:15:50,219
delegations that determines who
the President knighted states

2110
02:15:50,219 --> 02:15:54,059
will be. That being the case,
based on the election we just

2111
02:15:54,059 --> 02:15:58,919
had a couple of weeks ago, the
republicans controlled 26 state

2112
02:15:58,919 --> 02:16:02,309
delegations, the democrats
controlled 20 state delegations,

2113
02:16:02,549 --> 02:16:05,699
with the remainder being tied
with the possible exception of

2114
02:16:05,699 --> 02:16:10,829
Iowa. There's an uncalled Iowa
house race, if that is called in

2115
02:16:10,829 --> 02:16:14,489
favor of the GOP candidate who's
up last I saw about 47 votes,

2116
02:16:15,149 --> 02:16:20,219
then there will be 27 state
delegations that have a majority

2117
02:16:20,249 --> 02:16:24,899
of their members being
Republican, hence, the house

2118
02:16:25,019 --> 02:16:30,389
would be in a position to elect
a republican to the White House,

2119
02:16:30,869 --> 02:16:34,589
based on what we saw a couple of
weeks ago on Election Day,

2120
02:16:34,649 --> 02:16:38,789
earlier in November, November
the third, there you go. I think

2121
02:16:38,789 --> 02:16:42,119
Trump has it. Yeah, I don't know
how many times you're gonna play

2122
02:16:42,119 --> 02:16:45,749
variations of that exact same
scenario. I've never, I don't

2123
02:16:45,749 --> 02:16:48,239
think we've ever played this
exact scenario. This is the

2124
02:16:48,239 --> 02:16:53,159
first time I've ever heard it
explained so clearly. But I will

2125
02:16:53,189 --> 02:16:54,689
give you the clearly part.

2126
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:58,320
But it's been played one way or
the other.

2127
02:17:00,240 --> 02:17:03,450
Two or three times, actually,
I'd had to dig up to those Well,

2128
02:17:03,450 --> 02:17:06,780
okay, but then then help me just
in quick review, so we don't

2129
02:17:06,780 --> 02:17:09,180
have to ever play it again. So
we understand because I saw the

2130
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:11,250
troll room also go legally.

2131
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:17,790
There's already one house member
who was going to reject that's

2132
02:17:17,790 --> 02:17:22,590
Mo, that's mo Brooks. If one
senator does the same, then

2133
02:17:22,590 --> 02:17:25,290
there's a possibility that
several of these contested

2134
02:17:25,320 --> 02:17:29,580
states will go away and be
struck and taken off would be I

2135
02:17:29,580 --> 02:17:34,200
mean, it is a possibility.
That's what he said. Yeah. And

2136
02:17:34,230 --> 02:17:40,710
then it seems like it may go
eventually to the States. I

2137
02:17:40,710 --> 02:17:43,950
mean, that's the ultimate I keep
hearing his although this Iowa

2138
02:17:43,950 --> 02:17:46,860
thing seems like there's a
little a little snake in the

2139
02:17:46,860 --> 02:17:51,480
grass there that could thwart
everything, but that will create

2140
02:17:51,510 --> 02:17:57,570
a lot of friction, a lot of
strife. And part of the strategy

2141
02:17:57,570 --> 02:18:03,030
I think, not knowing anything,
is to a blanket is much of the

2142
02:18:03,030 --> 02:18:07,440
alternative media universe.
That's rumble that

2143
02:18:08,910 --> 02:18:14,010
parlor, but it's also podcasts
with as much of the actual

2144
02:18:14,010 --> 02:18:16,890
documentation as possible. I'm
certainly receiving

2145
02:18:18,210 --> 02:18:22,350
just document after document.
Certainly when it as it pertains

2146
02:18:22,350 --> 02:18:27,870
to China, who apparently printed
up 5 million ballots complained

2147
02:18:27,870 --> 02:18:31,860
they couldn't get the the the
metallic watermark right, and

2148
02:18:31,860 --> 02:18:35,280
shipped it with medical supplies
to the US to be distributed pre

2149
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:38,640
printed with Biden as the as the
selection.

2150
02:18:41,370 --> 02:18:46,500
It sounds to me like this would
be possible.

2151
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:52,680
Certainly winnings possible,
certainly likely the likelihood

2152
02:18:52,680 --> 02:18:55,470
we have to deal with and the
likelihood is pretty close to

2153
02:18:55,470 --> 02:18:58,680
zero. Why do you say that? Why
do you see it so close to zero?

2154
02:18:58,680 --> 02:19:01,950
Can we at least give a 5050
almost go are the same thing.

2155
02:19:01,950 --> 02:19:06,480
Again, you have all the
intelligence agencies, the CIA,

2156
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:11,370
the FBI, the entire mainstream
media, most of the news, the

2157
02:19:11,370 --> 02:19:15,450
major news organizations, The
New York Times, Washington Post,

2158
02:19:15,630 --> 02:19:19,770
everybody all lined up against
this president to get him kicked

2159
02:19:19,770 --> 02:19:22,770
out in any way they can correct.
I just don't see how you can

2160
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:27,360
what your one or two represents,
like mo Brooks is going to

2161
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:30,600
really put a stop to this. It's
like a juggernaut in the favor

2162
02:19:30,600 --> 02:19:33,180
of Biden. And that's what's
happening. And I don't see any

2163
02:19:33,180 --> 02:19:36,660
way of stopping it. And you
yourself used to play the clip

2164
02:19:36,870 --> 02:19:41,010
where it was Ron Paul, who said,
Well, you know, the CIA kind of

2165
02:19:41,010 --> 02:19:44,040
took over running the country
when they killed Kennedy, which

2166
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:47,730
is an old clip this in the
archives, which I which I still

2167
02:19:47,730 --> 02:19:48,510
believe Yes.

2168
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:52,710
And if that's the case, then
they're running the country and

2169
02:19:52,710 --> 02:19:54,900
they don't want Trump in anymore
and they're going to end they'd

2170
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:58,770
luckily we didn't get shot. The
only thing I will correct you on

2171
02:19:58,950 --> 02:19:59,970
is that the

2172
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,870
most sophisticated intelligence
agency in the world is the

2173
02:20:04,110 --> 02:20:08,490
Defense Intelligence Agency.
It's bigger. And I think they

2174
02:20:08,490 --> 02:20:12,690
have access to more toys than
the CIA and the CIA recently had

2175
02:20:12,690 --> 02:20:17,760
special operations taken away
from them. So, yes, the the

2176
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:20,670
Special Operations was not taken
away from the CEO that special

2177
02:20:20,670 --> 02:20:25,470
operations is taken away from
the the military, the army and

2178
02:20:25,470 --> 02:20:29,850
the military jsoc. Guys, the CIA
still could do what they want.

2179
02:20:30,930 --> 02:20:35,850
Well, so Okay, now the budget of
the DEA and they, if that's if

2180
02:20:35,880 --> 02:20:36,810
that's iffy.

2181
02:20:38,100 --> 02:20:40,950
And who has the best toys
supposed to be? Right? All

2182
02:20:40,950 --> 02:20:43,170
right. All right. But let's,
let's just separate this into

2183
02:20:43,170 --> 02:20:47,130
two things. I have no argument
with you about the power of the

2184
02:20:47,160 --> 02:20:50,580
of all the intelligence agencies
and the media, which I don't

2185
02:20:50,580 --> 02:20:53,610
even know why you separate those
two, but Okay, well, we'll call

2186
02:20:53,610 --> 02:20:56,340
them two separate things that
mainstream media and the

2187
02:20:56,340 --> 02:20:58,590
intelligence community, but
they're not there, they're

2188
02:20:58,590 --> 02:21:02,730
saying, I have no, I no doubt, I
do not underestimate their

2189
02:21:02,730 --> 02:21:07,020
power. But I think we can agree
that the Constitution is now

2190
02:21:07,020 --> 02:21:11,250
against that power. And we'll
see what happens. Is that that

2191
02:21:11,250 --> 02:21:15,090
is that the the final word on
this? That Yes? Seems like

2192
02:21:15,090 --> 02:21:18,060
there's a possibility, but it'll
never happen because of the

2193
02:21:18,060 --> 02:21:21,540
intelligence agencies and the
media, which is the same group?

2194
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:25,320
Well, I don't think it's the
same group, because they're not

2195
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:27,960
necessarily everyone that works
for the media is not getting

2196
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:32,550
paid by the by the CIA. You
understand what? You understand

2197
02:21:32,550 --> 02:21:35,550
the point? Yes. But it's still
not to say these are separate

2198
02:21:35,550 --> 02:21:38,790
groups in the public eye. And in
separate groups with their own

2199
02:21:38,790 --> 02:21:41,220
kind of, you know, they push
push here, and they push push

2200
02:21:41,220 --> 02:21:44,010
there, and they've done a really
good job with COVID. If you

2201
02:21:44,010 --> 02:21:48,570
haven't noticed, as we have our
show, I just, it's the

2202
02:21:48,600 --> 02:21:52,800
likelihood to me is zero. But
we'll see. I mean, it's great. I

2203
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:55,800
think it would be fabulous. If
we could get an exercise in

2204
02:21:55,800 --> 02:21:59,880
this, because we've never seen
it before that we have is we

2205
02:21:59,880 --> 02:22:02,340
haven't hundred years. We
haven't but it has happened.

2206
02:22:02,370 --> 02:22:05,580
Yeah. Within the last nobody
living No, has witnessed this.

2207
02:22:05,580 --> 02:22:10,740
No, no. Okay, that's fine. So
I'm just saying that this is

2208
02:22:10,740 --> 02:22:14,910
This, to me was a very clear
path. Now I have a date, which

2209
02:22:14,910 --> 02:22:18,420
is January 5, so it'd be the
January 6. And now we know what

2210
02:22:18,420 --> 02:22:21,450
to look forward to. And now I
can not worry so much and have

2211
02:22:21,450 --> 02:22:24,540
this pay attention. I know what
needs to be done.

2212
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:29,430
And we'll see if that happens.
We'll see if that happens. Very

2213
02:22:29,430 --> 02:22:32,280
I do not like the idea of
Sydney.

2214
02:22:33,810 --> 02:22:37,980
Miss Sydney, telling people not
to vote in the runoff in

2215
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:41,490
Georgia. I really don't like the
idea. And luckily there's no

2216
02:22:41,490 --> 02:22:44,970
she's not she's not working for
the for the President. I don't

2217
02:22:44,970 --> 02:22:49,710
even know if she's a member of
the republican party. That I'm

2218
02:22:49,710 --> 02:22:52,830
just saying she's represents
herself is working for the

2219
02:22:52,830 --> 02:22:58,350
President. Even though she's not
a she represents a certain side

2220
02:22:58,350 --> 02:23:01,770
of the of the argument your
side. And I think it's

2221
02:23:01,770 --> 02:23:04,710
irresponsible for her to say
that because I think that that

2222
02:23:04,710 --> 02:23:08,490
election will be carefully
monitored, and probably be much

2223
02:23:08,490 --> 02:23:11,340
more legitimate than the
original. And I think these

2224
02:23:11,340 --> 02:23:14,190
people shouldn't be discouraged
from voting because this is more

2225
02:23:14,190 --> 02:23:16,560
important than anything else
going on is making sure that one

2226
02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:20,010
of those two people win a senate
seat, especially against the two

2227
02:23:20,010 --> 02:23:23,880
creeps are running against
names. And in particular, that

2228
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:27,600
guy, the light guy that's
running against the republican

2229
02:23:27,780 --> 02:23:33,600
is an outrageous, beta O'Rourke
level creep. And he needs to not

2230
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:39,720
win one correction. I, Sidney
Powell does not represent my

2231
02:23:39,720 --> 02:23:43,350
side, you really need to stop
that I represent on his show.

2232
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:47,310
That's exactly exactly what my
saying it constantly just does

2233
02:23:47,310 --> 02:23:51,360
exactly what you said. You said,
Sidney Powell said it once. I

2234
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:54,840
will not say it again. But she
is in my opinion.

2235
02:23:55,950 --> 02:23:58,800
representing your side I guess
I'm wrong. I don't know what I'm

2236
02:23:58,860 --> 02:24:02,700
what I you cut me off. I want to
say I on this show, I am

2237
02:24:02,700 --> 02:24:06,270
representing her side to make
sure at least we hear it. It's

2238
02:24:06,270 --> 02:24:09,420
fine if you don't like her. And
obviously it's not a very smart

2239
02:24:09,420 --> 02:24:13,440
thing for the for the Republican
Party for her and Lynwood to say

2240
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:16,650
don't vote. Personally, I don't
give a shit. I don't care if

2241
02:24:16,650 --> 02:24:19,890
people vote in Georgia or not. I
would like to see this part,

2242
02:24:19,890 --> 02:24:23,220
just the constitutional part.
Run through. I would like to

2243
02:24:23,220 --> 02:24:26,580
know a little bit more. I'd like
to see the report. That is due

2244
02:24:26,580 --> 02:24:27,120
from

2245
02:24:28,290 --> 02:24:32,730
Defense Intelligence 45 days
after the election. That's what

2246
02:24:32,730 --> 02:24:36,690
I'd like to see. I'm interested
in that. My dog in the hunt is

2247
02:24:36,750 --> 02:24:40,770
elections moving forward, and
not even for me, because I don't

2248
02:24:40,770 --> 02:24:44,580
care. We'll be fine. We'll do
the show. We could we've taken a

2249
02:24:44,580 --> 02:24:47,340
vow of poverty. Maybe I'm
interested in our children to

2250
02:24:47,340 --> 02:24:52,200
see how they'll do. That's all.
I'm not. I'm not a rabid nut.

2251
02:24:52,470 --> 02:24:57,060
People who are rabid nuts on
real television, like ABC. Like

2252
02:24:57,060 --> 02:24:59,970
the view. The bottom line is
that the party

2253
02:25:00,539 --> 02:25:04,169
The President's pardon power is
really expensive. I wouldn't say

2254
02:25:04,169 --> 02:25:07,679
it's exhaustive. Like you can't
pardon someone from impeachment.

2255
02:25:07,679 --> 02:25:12,329
But there's no question. I think
that you can issue a blanket

2256
02:25:12,359 --> 02:25:16,589
pardon, even for crimes that,
you know, were committed, maybe

2257
02:25:16,589 --> 02:25:19,949
perhaps, could be that haven't
even been charged that could be

2258
02:25:19,949 --> 02:25:23,159
charged. So his powers pretty
exhausted. But the one thing he

2259
02:25:23,159 --> 02:25:26,969
can't be pardoned for would be
state crimes. He can only pardon

2260
02:25:26,969 --> 02:25:30,479
really for federal crimes. So I
would imagine that mark is still

2261
02:25:30,479 --> 02:25:34,739
open to investigation, Florida
still, Tisha James is waiting on

2262
02:25:34,949 --> 02:25:38,999
some of these. She really is, as
the Attorney General of New York

2263
02:25:39,659 --> 02:25:42,509
agian that, you know, is part in
power.

2264
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:46,440
The other thing I want to
mention is that what is

2265
02:25:46,440 --> 02:25:49,110
interesting to me is once you
pardon someone like Michael

2266
02:25:49,110 --> 02:25:53,700
Flynn, that gives people
immunity. So Michael Flynn could

2267
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:55,350
decide to turn against Trump and

2268
02:25:56,520 --> 02:26:00,900
so it's really not the best
sure. But I don't know that that

2269
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:02,010
Trump has thought that through.

2270
02:26:03,240 --> 02:26:06,330
Now, oh, wait, wait, there's
something that happened right on

2271
02:26:06,330 --> 02:26:09,030
this In this segment, which, you
know, we talked about in the

2272
02:26:09,030 --> 02:26:11,850
last show that they have some
somehow Trump's gonna pardon his

2273
02:26:11,850 --> 02:26:15,630
whole family and himself. But
I've never heard this next bit

2274
02:26:15,630 --> 02:26:19,050
happen on the view already. But
you also have a legal note. Do

2275
02:26:19,050 --> 02:26:21,690
you have to wait, we have this
legal note that you're supposed

2276
02:26:21,690 --> 02:26:25,590
to do you need to read that?
Yeah. Okay. Yes. So we all read

2277
02:26:25,590 --> 02:26:29,520
it together has repeatedly Go
ahead, sonny. Trump has

2278
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:32,910
repeatedly denied any
wrongdoing, saying

2279
02:26:32,910 --> 02:26:36,030
investigations into his conduct
in office, and his business

2280
02:26:36,030 --> 02:26:39,510
dealings are motivated by
politics. He has also denied

2281
02:26:39,510 --> 02:26:42,780
allegations of sexual misconduct
and affairs, saying payments

2282
02:26:42,900 --> 02:26:47,700
were a personal matter. Not a
campaign expense. I never heard

2283
02:26:47,700 --> 02:26:50,010
them forced to do a legal
disclaimer.

2284
02:26:52,710 --> 02:26:53,910
I've never heard that.

2285
02:26:55,290 --> 02:26:58,830
Well, I don't think anyone has
but what was the point of it?

2286
02:26:58,860 --> 02:27:02,310
What was I don't know there? Are
there I I know what it is.

2287
02:27:03,480 --> 02:27:06,930
I Trump known as a little
litigious type

2288
02:27:08,130 --> 02:27:12,090
A if he doesn't get back in
office, which, in my opinion, he

2289
02:27:12,090 --> 02:27:15,810
won't, he will sue the hell out
of it.

2290
02:27:16,950 --> 02:27:20,670
We'll see the way just thinking
about it now. I think it

2291
02:27:20,670 --> 02:27:25,410
pertains to the executive order
about misinformation. That could

2292
02:27:25,410 --> 02:27:28,650
be that's what there's all kinds
of elements there. That's what

2293
02:27:28,650 --> 02:27:31,620
I'm thinking but that was funny,
especially when they stopped in

2294
02:27:31,620 --> 02:27:33,090
their tracks. I have

2295
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:37,260
this I think there may be a
kicker 19 seconds left.

2296
02:27:38,280 --> 02:27:41,820
I think it's very exciting that
you know, he can he can try to

2297
02:27:41,820 --> 02:27:45,480
precompile themselves federally,
but there are all these people

2298
02:27:45,480 --> 02:27:48,840
waiting Letitia James is waiting
with her little foot she has

2299
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:51,750
patent that foot waiting for him
to make a step out because he

2300
02:27:51,750 --> 02:27:55,320
keeps saying he's going run in
2024 you're not gonna run if

2301
02:27:55,320 --> 02:27:56,520
you're in jail, my friend.

2302
02:27:57,840 --> 02:28:02,640
They want him in jail so bad. I
will say everybody wants it for

2303
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:07,170
some reason. This is really
disturbing. I might add all my

2304
02:28:07,170 --> 02:28:12,150
liberal friends not only one him
in jail, but they think and they

2305
02:28:12,150 --> 02:28:15,720
have a little laundry list I
keep promising I'll print one of

2306
02:28:15,720 --> 02:28:19,020
these out of why he should be in
jail. None of them

2307
02:28:20,280 --> 02:28:23,550
jailable I mean, nothing like
Hillary's little violation there

2308
02:28:23,550 --> 02:28:26,670
was her own server which was
against the national security

2309
02:28:26,670 --> 02:28:29,580
laws. All right. Do you have
what is this from the lip Joe's

2310
02:28:29,580 --> 02:28:33,540
or just you liberal lib? tard
more than the lip Joe's? Okay.

2311
02:28:33,630 --> 02:28:36,960
And what what's the list? What
what? Why should he go? He's a

2312
02:28:36,960 --> 02:28:37,680
liar.

2313
02:28:42,780 --> 02:28:49,410
Okay, do not pass go go directly
to jail for lying. Right? Yeah,

2314
02:28:49,440 --> 02:28:51,510
he must have 30,000 counts of
lying.

2315
02:28:52,830 --> 02:28:55,890
It's unbelievable. That's it.
That's why

2316
02:28:57,150 --> 02:28:59,910
there's a laundry list but lying
Is that the right there in the

2317
02:28:59,910 --> 02:29:04,020
middle of it? Not the top
rather. I said but I'll read dig

2318
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:06,330
up the list and read it for the
next show. The next show will

2319
02:29:06,330 --> 02:29:10,050
how pull out the list of a very
important person who is a

2320
02:29:10,050 --> 02:29:10,830
liberal

2321
02:29:11,970 --> 02:29:16,680
and thinks of himself as a
moderate and he's known very

2322
02:29:16,860 --> 02:29:20,280
somewhat devout, not somewhat,
very famous person. And he's got

2323
02:29:20,280 --> 02:29:23,010
this little list and he thinks
Trump should be in jail. And

2324
02:29:23,010 --> 02:29:26,820
it's just like the worst of the
lip Joes they should all think

2325
02:29:26,820 --> 02:29:30,480
he should be in jail. I mean,
one of the lip Joes is going on

2326
02:29:30,480 --> 02:29:35,460
about how Giuliana should be in
jail. For lying for years he

2327
02:29:35,460 --> 02:29:39,960
should be in jail. He's that
he's a crook is a crook. Hmm. I

2328
02:29:40,020 --> 02:29:44,070
it's just it's unbelievable and
I can't even get it. I do want

2329
02:29:44,070 --> 02:29:45,060
to play this clip though.

2330
02:29:46,200 --> 02:29:49,500
This is a on the damage being
done by what we just play the

2331
02:29:49,500 --> 02:29:54,000
damage of this questionable
election. In fact that dead I

2332
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:57,450
think gore still stretch it out
longer than this, but it's not

2333
02:29:57,450 --> 02:29:58,200
the same.

2334
02:29:59,760 --> 02:29:59,970
Good

2335
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,100
As Trump is not your right,

2336
02:30:04,290 --> 02:30:05,820
this is Shields and Brooks.

2337
02:30:07,500 --> 02:30:10,110
And of course these two guys,
they agree with each other more

2338
02:30:10,110 --> 02:30:12,390
than anything else. There's
hardly a debate between the two

2339
02:30:12,390 --> 02:30:15,420
of them. They're in lockstep
agree lockstep agreement. And

2340
02:30:15,420 --> 02:30:19,170
they're both Democrats, and they
both hate Trump and, and they're

2341
02:30:19,230 --> 02:30:23,550
in their analysis stinks to high
heaven exactly why they're on

2342
02:30:23,550 --> 02:30:28,080
PBS. And the analysis in this
case, Brooks makes an assertion

2343
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:30,300
and then contradicts his the
assertion with actual

2344
02:30:30,300 --> 02:30:35,250
information. And then he admits
that he's befuddled by anything,

2345
02:30:35,250 --> 02:30:37,560
and it doesn't really be
funneled by everything. But

2346
02:30:37,560 --> 02:30:42,390
let's play this how much damage
is being done by what is going

2347
02:30:42,390 --> 02:30:43,260
on right now, Mark?

2348
02:30:44,610 --> 02:30:49,320
I can't calculate it God in
concrete terms of this a, it's

2349
02:30:49,320 --> 02:30:52,620
dangerous. I mean, America has
been the envy of the world.

2350
02:30:52,620 --> 02:30:55,590
That's been the example to bring
millions of people who are

2351
02:30:55,590 --> 02:30:59,310
assures a free and open
democracy where every voice is

2352
02:30:59,310 --> 02:31:05,790
heard, and to have the elected
leader of that nation charged

2353
02:31:05,790 --> 02:31:10,680
that it is not that that is
corrupt, that it's criminal, is

2354
02:31:10,680 --> 02:31:12,870
damaging beyond my calculation.

2355
02:31:14,010 --> 02:31:19,530
I just, I think I hope it's
reparable. But, you know, we

2356
02:31:19,530 --> 02:31:23,190
will, it'll be a while before we
find out just how much damage

2357
02:31:23,190 --> 02:31:23,880
has been done.

2358
02:31:25,650 --> 02:31:32,580
David, how, how deep is is the
damage that's being done. While

2359
02:31:32,580 --> 02:31:36,060
77% of Republicans or Trump
backers say the election was

2360
02:31:36,060 --> 02:31:39,240
stolen by fraud, according to a
Monmouth poll. A lot of those

2361
02:31:39,240 --> 02:31:41,580
same people don't believe in
manmade climate change. A lot of

2362
02:31:41,580 --> 02:31:44,340
those some people don't believe
that masks and save your life.

2363
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:49,470
become detached from reality.
And under Trump paranoia has

2364
02:31:49,470 --> 02:31:52,800
become a style of research and
style. I wrote a column about

2365
02:31:52,800 --> 02:31:56,640
this a week ago. And I tried to
theorize that this derives out

2366
02:31:56,640 --> 02:31:59,790
of a sense of menace and threat
that people feel existentially

2367
02:31:59,790 --> 02:32:02,970
unsafe. And so they grasp for
conspiracy theories, because it

2368
02:32:02,970 --> 02:32:05,820
makes them feel powerful that
they see the truth. It makes it

2369
02:32:05,820 --> 02:32:09,720
feel agency, they can expose the
evil cabal. And I think there's

2370
02:32:09,720 --> 02:32:12,570
some truth to that, that people
a lot of people just feel very

2371
02:32:12,570 --> 02:32:17,280
scared economically, socially,
racially. And out of that fear

2372
02:32:17,280 --> 02:32:20,850
comes paranoia. But I got a lot
of emails from people like I got

2373
02:32:20,850 --> 02:32:24,270
one from a guy in Palo Alto. He
said the neurosurgeon down my

2374
02:32:24,270 --> 02:32:27,630
block believes all this stuff.
So where's his anxiety? And I'd

2375
02:32:27,630 --> 02:32:31,500
say, I don't know the answer to
that question. Oh, science, just

2376
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:36,870
yell science. So the thing is,
he brings up this, you know,

2377
02:32:36,870 --> 02:32:40,920
this is the deplorables
argument. Anyone who supported

2378
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:43,800
Trump was a deplorable, and
they're in a bucket, a bucket of

2379
02:32:43,800 --> 02:32:46,650
display marbles in this case,
Brooks says that, you know,

2380
02:32:46,650 --> 02:32:50,130
people feel it's the people who
feel unsafe. It's the people who

2381
02:32:50,130 --> 02:32:53,490
see a menace is the people who I
got there. That's your neighbor

2382
02:32:53,490 --> 02:32:57,450
insecure, they're scared,
they're fearful. It's just the

2383
02:32:57,450 --> 02:33:02,040
opposite. The people that I see
that are scared and fearful, or

2384
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:05,370
the Brooks's, and the shields
and the people shaking in their

2385
02:33:05,370 --> 02:33:08,910
boots about COVID Yeah, that's
not the people that that support

2386
02:33:08,910 --> 02:33:09,450
Trump.

2387
02:33:10,590 --> 02:33:13,350
The people won't walk around
without a mask is not somebody

2388
02:33:13,350 --> 02:33:14,940
who's fearful and scared.

2389
02:33:15,960 --> 02:33:19,800
So he's got He can't even make
this analysis. even remotely

2390
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:23,940
correct. And he's like, the main
guy, New York Times columnist.

2391
02:33:24,090 --> 02:33:26,700
Boom, he's on here and he admits
himself he says, I don't get it.

2392
02:33:26,700 --> 02:33:28,380
Why this neuroscientist?

2393
02:33:31,320 --> 02:33:32,490
guy I'm confused.

2394
02:33:33,870 --> 02:33:36,720
The neuroscientist believes this
what's going on with the world?

2395
02:33:37,950 --> 02:33:41,430
Yeah. You know what? He should
get a little vocal fry? Could be

2396
02:33:41,430 --> 02:33:42,780
editor. Yeah.

2397
02:33:43,830 --> 02:33:48,000
So call back. Yeah, pretty good.
We can do pretty good. Oh,

2398
02:33:48,030 --> 02:33:52,050
Brexit, just as we predicted,
but we predicted it a year ago

2399
02:33:52,050 --> 02:33:56,070
without the Rona. Yeah, it looks
like that's off now. You know,

2400
02:33:56,070 --> 02:33:59,940
this is supposed to be sewn up
and finalized. December 23. I'm

2401
02:33:59,940 --> 02:34:03,960
missing this. I missed this.
Well, so Brexit really hadn't

2402
02:34:03,960 --> 02:34:08,700
happened. Yes, it happened. But
the deal it was it was in name

2403
02:34:08,700 --> 02:34:13,680
only a bynoe. A Brexit in name
only. I just made this up. I got

2404
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:16,830
to write that down by No. So
they had the mine Oh.

2405
02:34:18,180 --> 02:34:21,390
And but they had no deal. The
deal with the EU still had to be

2406
02:34:21,390 --> 02:34:24,510
finalized. And this was supposed
to be done as it needs to be

2407
02:34:24,510 --> 02:34:28,770
done by December 23. And it's
not getting done. So and this is

2408
02:34:28,770 --> 02:34:32,700
all about the trade. Brexit Tate
trade talks critical point.

2409
02:34:33,150 --> 02:34:36,900
Yeah, that's also that border of
Northern Ireland. That's the big

2410
02:34:36,900 --> 02:34:41,970
bone of contention. deal with
that Scotland waters all of this

2411
02:34:41,970 --> 02:34:45,630
stuff. That's not Jesse waters,
brother, Scotland waters.

2412
02:34:46,410 --> 02:34:49,590
Scotland waters is oil, oil and
fish.

2413
02:34:50,610 --> 02:34:53,820
Oil and fish fish is a big deal
for oily fish.

2414
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:58,140
So we take a quick little break
and then we can get into talking

2415
02:34:58,140 --> 02:34:59,100
about bynoe

2416
02:35:00,329 --> 02:35:03,599
Briggs that was it. Brexit in
name only? No, I just came up

2417
02:35:03,599 --> 02:35:08,249
with I like it. I like to try.
No, we're using it by no show

2418
02:35:08,249 --> 02:35:11,549
name. I do have a quick bit of
entertainment showbiz news,

2419
02:35:12,149 --> 02:35:15,509
which I think is important,
because we've declared how I've

2420
02:35:15,509 --> 02:35:18,209
declared Hollywood dead. I'll
say we I think you agree.

2421
02:35:19,410 --> 02:35:22,680
And something very big happened
in Hollywood, which is an

2422
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:24,060
extension of China.

2423
02:35:25,320 --> 02:35:30,300
So whether this is Hollywood,
finally, drawing the noose close

2424
02:35:30,300 --> 02:35:34,020
around this neck or China doing
it for them is to be determined.

2425
02:35:34,350 --> 02:35:37,050
But the only person who can tell
you what's going on in Hollywood

2426
02:35:37,050 --> 02:35:42,120
is of course, the YouTuber known
as overlord DVD. My forces

2427
02:35:42,120 --> 02:35:46,170
informed me that today Disney is
holding high level emergency

2428
02:35:46,170 --> 02:35:50,460
meetings. I was informed of this
yesterday afternoon. Then later

2429
02:35:50,460 --> 02:35:54,660
in the evening, I was informed
that Paramount MGM pretty much

2430
02:35:54,690 --> 02:35:58,320
all the studios in Hollywood are
holding emergency meetings

2431
02:35:58,320 --> 02:36:02,070
today. To discuss the bombshell
dropped by The Hollywood

2432
02:36:02,070 --> 02:36:05,940
Reporter yesterday regarding
Warner Brothers decision to

2433
02:36:05,940 --> 02:36:11,640
release their entire 2021 Slater
films directly on HBO max. The

2434
02:36:11,640 --> 02:36:15,570
article that is sent Hollywood
into a panicked tailspin was

2435
02:36:15,570 --> 02:36:19,860
titled Warner Brothers smashes
box office Windows will send

2436
02:36:19,860 --> 02:36:26,130
entire 2021 slate to HBO, Max
and theaters. The article reads.

2437
02:36:26,520 --> 02:36:29,460
In an unprecedented
announcement, the studio will

2438
02:36:29,460 --> 02:36:34,710
send 17 films, including the
matrix for the Suicide Squad and

2439
02:36:34,710 --> 02:36:39,510
due to its streaming service for
31 days the same day they hit

2440
02:36:39,510 --> 02:36:42,960
theaters. Warner Brothers is
plotting a sweeping response to

2441
02:36:42,960 --> 02:36:46,380
the ongoing pandemic which has
shuttered movie theaters around

2442
02:36:46,380 --> 02:36:51,180
the country. After announcing
Wonder Woman 1984 we'll go to

2443
02:36:51,180 --> 02:36:55,500
HBO max as well as theaters
December 25. The studio is laid

2444
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:59,970
out a similar path for its 2021
slate amid uncertainty about

2445
02:36:59,970 --> 02:37:02,490
when moving going we'll get back
to normal

2446
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:07,020
and informed the voices Baron
von Doom caulk.

2447
02:37:08,340 --> 02:37:11,940
I like that guy. He wears a you
know, he wears a mask he wears.

2448
02:37:12,480 --> 02:37:18,780
like a like a Transformers nose
comic. Yeah, but this is a big

2449
02:37:18,780 --> 02:37:21,960
deal. This is what everyone
didn't want to happen is that

2450
02:37:21,960 --> 02:37:24,810
one of the studios says screw it
we're putting it all online. We

2451
02:37:24,810 --> 02:37:27,510
don't give a crap about the
theaters take a beating and get

2452
02:37:27,510 --> 02:37:29,820
it over with I don't think I
don't think they can recover.

2453
02:37:31,170 --> 02:37:33,900
I don't know I think the studios
are gonna have to merge or

2454
02:37:33,900 --> 02:37:36,480
something. They're not going to
be able to survive. Ah, Disney

2455
02:37:36,480 --> 02:37:40,560
will buy more. Yeah, just to buy
more Disney is already a mess.

2456
02:37:40,680 --> 02:37:43,620
If you've ever looked at the
Disney org chart, I have a copy

2457
02:37:43,620 --> 02:37:47,070
someplace. It is I couldn't even
I couldn't put the newsletter.

2458
02:37:47,070 --> 02:37:51,390
You can't do anything with it.
It is a monster. It is a huge

2459
02:37:51,390 --> 02:37:53,910
it's like the map of the world
with all these different

2460
02:37:53,910 --> 02:37:57,600
companies and all these arrows
going every which way Disney? I

2461
02:37:57,600 --> 02:38:02,520
don't see how it does they can
continue to to be this monster

2462
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:03,660
company that it is.

2463
02:38:04,950 --> 02:38:08,640
These guys, it'd be tough to
know. I know the movie business

2464
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:13,830
has got to be getting the water.
Well, Tina and I met a couple

2465
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:16,620
who just moved to Austin from
Brooklyn.

2466
02:38:17,640 --> 02:38:22,110
And the husband works at a
Disney subsidiary.

2467
02:38:23,580 --> 02:38:26,310
I don't want to give them away.
But he's a he's the chief

2468
02:38:26,310 --> 02:38:29,760
financial officer. I think he's
a he's a C suite guy for a

2469
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:33,060
subsidiary that Disney purchased
a watch, you know, years ago.

2470
02:38:33,570 --> 02:38:39,210
And they are super conservative.
And they left Brooklyn because

2471
02:38:39,240 --> 02:38:41,400
they couldn't survive.

2472
02:38:42,540 --> 02:38:45,810
people hated them. And witches
and they'd lived there for I

2473
02:38:45,810 --> 02:38:48,840
don't know, 18 years. I think
they're both from one of them.

2474
02:38:48,840 --> 02:38:52,050
Maybe he's from the Midwest. But
I'm gonna ask about what what

2475
02:38:52,050 --> 02:38:54,420
the plan is because I think
we're seeing him next week or so

2476
02:38:54,420 --> 02:38:55,200
for another dinner.

2477
02:38:56,580 --> 02:38:59,790
And it's Brooklyn because they
were outspoken and you said

2478
02:38:59,790 --> 02:39:03,480
hello. And Hey, hello. They were
a Brit magga hat. I mean, what

2479
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:07,380
did they get rousted? Well, they
rousted themselves out because I

2480
02:39:07,380 --> 02:39:11,520
think it was they they learned
through election of the 700

2481
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:14,760
people that lives kind of in
their district or whatever it is

2482
02:39:14,940 --> 02:39:17,370
699 families

2483
02:39:18,390 --> 02:39:19,140
were all

2484
02:39:20,880 --> 02:39:27,390
democrats and six families.
Republican and I think that just

2485
02:39:28,020 --> 02:39:31,860
all of this came down on them
what Cuomo is doing and what de

2486
02:39:31,860 --> 02:39:34,740
Blasio and they don't even know
if they can ever sell their

2487
02:39:34,740 --> 02:39:35,400
house.

2488
02:39:36,690 --> 02:39:40,050
No, they said, we just make it
public and lived in there. Don't

2489
02:39:40,050 --> 02:39:44,820
buy it, you're get contaminated
with a up and left. Yeah. And

2490
02:39:44,820 --> 02:39:47,490
the interesting thing is that
the upper echelon of this

2491
02:39:47,490 --> 02:39:50,910
particular company is very
conservative, very right wing.

2492
02:39:52,620 --> 02:39:56,550
So we'll see how they fare under
this Disney stuff. Anyway, it's

2493

02:54:55,560 --> 02:54:56,730

2720
02:55:08,849 --> 02:55:09,719

Nick get lucky today and get the
show in in under three hours.

2722
02:55:16,560 --> 02:55:19,140
I haven't asked Adam. Oh my

2723
02:55:22,500 --> 02:55:23,220
Okay.

2724
02:55:25,230 --> 02:55:27,480
Do I just really the rohingyas
are being

2725
02:55:28,530 --> 02:55:32,070
rousted from Bangladesh is the
group that was kicked out of

2726
02:55:32,490 --> 02:55:38,160
Southeast Asia. And Jamar that's
the guys. Yeah, me and Mario's

2727
02:55:38,160 --> 02:55:42,510
guys. And so they're being
rousted because? No, I guess. I

2728
02:55:42,510 --> 02:55:45,480
don't know. These people have
nothing but bad little their

2729
02:55:45,480 --> 02:55:48,900
muscles get them out. It's not
what happened being moved to an

2730
02:55:48,900 --> 02:55:49,530
island.

2731
02:55:50,880 --> 02:55:53,910
A lot of Bangladeshis are
Muslim. And so and

2732
02:55:55,140 --> 02:55:57,390
yeah, and here's that this is
just a little piece of this

2733
02:55:57,390 --> 02:56:01,110
report from Democracy Now,
ironically, that's a clue by the

2734
02:56:01,110 --> 02:56:06,630
way. Yeah. To the to what I want
you to answer is what's what

2735
02:56:06,930 --> 02:56:12,240
stands out as very odd in this
report, and Bangladesh human

2736
02:56:12,240 --> 02:56:15,600
rights advocates are condemning
the relocation of thousands of

2737
02:56:15,600 --> 02:56:19,950
Rohingya refugees to an isolated
island. hours away from the

2738
02:56:19,950 --> 02:56:23,280
mainland. Police Thursday's
squirted refugees who were put

2739
02:56:23,280 --> 02:56:27,300
on buses for the long trek from
Cox's Bazar to a port town where

2740
02:56:27,300 --> 02:56:32,190
they'll be put on boats on route
to Boston char Island, which is

2741
02:56:32,220 --> 02:56:35,670
prone to flooding frequent
cyclones and only emerged from

2742
02:56:35,670 --> 02:56:39,420
the ocean two decades ago, the
islands never been inhabited. To

2743
02:56:39,420 --> 02:56:42,840
aid workers told Reuters
refugees were pressured into

2744
02:56:42,840 --> 02:56:46,560
move by government officials who
threaten them or offer them cash

2745
02:56:46,560 --> 02:56:50,130
and exchange Human Rights Watch
called the refugees relocation

2746
02:56:50,130 --> 02:56:53,130
quote, nothing short of a
dangerous mass detention of

2747
02:56:53,130 --> 02:56:56,700
Rohingya people in violation of
international human rights

2748
02:56:56,760 --> 02:56:57,870
obligations.

2749
02:57:00,600 --> 02:57:03,660
Okay, I think I know this one. I
don't often get these right. But

2750
02:57:03,660 --> 02:57:06,750
this one stuck out like a sore
thumb. What is wrong with this

2751
02:57:06,750 --> 02:57:07,320
report?

2752
02:57:08,790 --> 02:57:15,480
Ready? Yeah, the island that
appeared two decades ago, what

2753
02:57:15,480 --> 02:57:17,520
happened to global warming
wouldn't the islands

2754
02:57:19,710 --> 02:57:24,420
char Island, which is flooding
frequent cyclones and only

2755
02:57:24,420 --> 02:57:26,400
emerged from the ocean two
decades ago.

2756
02:57:28,500 --> 02:57:33,270
This is from a big global,
warmest Rao on

2757
02:57:34,470 --> 02:57:39,930
an island, unbelievable,
emerging in the last 20 years

2758
02:57:39,990 --> 02:57:45,780
when they should all be sinking.
This is so off message. I mean,

2759
02:57:45,840 --> 02:57:47,940
this is so off message.

2760
02:57:49,410 --> 02:57:54,150
Let's just I do have a few
global warming, great reset

2761
02:57:54,150 --> 02:57:57,420
clips to go through just before
we get out. I know we're the

2762
02:57:57,420 --> 02:57:58,980
affiliates are getting angry.
But

2763
02:58:00,390 --> 02:58:05,490
Dr. Ted Ross is doing the
connecting for all of us. He of

2764
02:58:05,490 --> 02:58:09,450
course, is the shill from the
World Health Organization. And

2765
02:58:09,450 --> 02:58:14,040
we must not go back to the same
exploitative patterns of

2766
02:58:14,040 --> 02:58:18,690
production and consumption, the
same disregard for the planet

2767
02:58:18,870 --> 02:58:24,510
that sustains all life, the same
cycle of panic and neglect. And

2768
02:58:24,510 --> 02:58:29,730
the same divisive politics that
fueled this pandemic. The

2769
02:58:29,730 --> 02:58:34,350
pandemic has brought us to a
fork in the road, a fork in the

2770
02:58:34,350 --> 02:58:38,610
road, behind the lies the
purpose of business as usual.

2771
02:58:38,670 --> 02:58:44,190
Okay, the path that led us to
this crisis, the, you know, the

2772
02:58:44,760 --> 02:58:47,880
mason jar that you're digging
peanut butter out of or

2773
02:58:47,880 --> 02:58:51,000
something really reads on the
mic. So just a little bit away

2774
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:54,420
from not even gonna touch that
thing again for a year. I don't

2775
02:58:54,420 --> 02:58:56,610
want to unmute you. I mean, in
case you have something to say.

2776
02:58:56,610 --> 02:59:01,620
So here we go before us lies a
new path, a path on which

2777
02:59:01,950 --> 02:59:07,290
nations do not see themselves as
rivals in a zero sum game. Oh,

2778
02:59:07,320 --> 02:59:13,590
but as fellows, travelers, with
the same aspirations, hopes and

2779
02:59:13,590 --> 02:59:17,790
dreams, ah, we are fellow
travelers, we say must be

2780
02:59:17,790 --> 02:59:21,990
nation's hopes and dreams, a
vision that affirms our common

2781
02:59:21,990 --> 02:59:27,900
history and our common future
that recognize we're richer for

2782
02:59:27,900 --> 02:59:33,150
our diversity, and that we are
more than the sum of our parts.

2783
02:59:33,570 --> 02:59:39,420
Our diversity is our beauty, and
even our strengths. 75 years

2784
02:59:39,480 --> 02:59:43,290
after its best, it's the United
Nations remains more relevant

2785
02:59:43,290 --> 02:59:46,140
than ever, and more essential
than ever.

2786
02:59:49,980 --> 02:59:52,800
What he's saying is, listen to
these guys, I have the UN

2787
02:59:52,800 --> 02:59:56,040
Secretary given delivering bad
news you and I want I don't want

2788
02:59:56,040 --> 02:59:57,840
you to do that in a way to
finish with that.

2789
02:59:59,460 --> 03:00:00,000
After we

2790
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:04,440
Go through the New Zealand Prime
Minister because she takes the

2791
03:00:04,440 --> 03:00:09,660
cake. She is the number one rule
follower of the United Nations

2792
03:00:09,660 --> 03:00:13,590
World Health Organization, build
back better great reset

2793
03:00:14,040 --> 03:00:18,960
producers in New Zealand. I
would strongly encourage you to

2794
03:00:18,960 --> 03:00:24,000
get out while you can. This
woman is out of control. Mr.

2795
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:27,480
Speaker, I think the first and
most important point to make is

2796
03:00:27,480 --> 03:00:32,370
that this is a declaration.
based on science science. The

2797
03:00:32,370 --> 03:00:36,300
United Nations Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change the

2798
03:00:36,360 --> 03:00:39,780
preeminent scientific body in
the world on this matter has

2799
03:00:39,780 --> 03:00:45,720
determined that in order to
avoid a situation, a disaster is

2800
03:00:45,720 --> 03:00:49,800
1.5 degrees Celsius rising
temperatures and beyond a rise

2801
03:00:49,800 --> 03:00:53,010
that would see increased risk to
human health and livelihood

2802
03:00:53,010 --> 03:00:57,120
civil and Reese mess drought
myths, disease, loss of lands

2803
03:00:57,120 --> 03:01:01,890
and homes, increased fires,
increased tropical storms, Miss

2804
03:01:01,890 --> 03:01:06,270
human displacement and globally
exhausted resources, then we

2805
03:01:06,270 --> 03:01:09,690
must act with urgency mr.
speaker to ensure global

2806
03:01:09,690 --> 03:01:15,660
emissions fall to net zero by
2015 means consigning our region

2807
03:01:15,660 --> 03:01:20,160
to a devastating reality that if
we are responsible members of

2808
03:01:20,160 --> 03:01:24,990
the Pacific, we cannot and will
not accept, Mr. Speaker, this

2809
03:01:24,990 --> 03:01:27,840
declaration is an
acknowledgement of the next

2810
03:01:27,870 --> 03:01:31,650
generation and acknowledgement
of the burden that they will

2811
03:01:31,650 --> 03:01:35,370
carry if we do not get this
right. And if we do not take

2812
03:01:35,370 --> 03:01:39,810
action now, as a government, we
are also announcing the carbon

2813
03:01:39,840 --> 03:01:43,440
neutral government program that
requires government

2814
03:01:43,440 --> 03:01:49,980
organizations to be carbon
neutral by 2025.

2815
03:01:54,840 --> 03:01:59,760
To get our own house in order,
how can we stand and take a

2816
03:01:59,760 --> 03:02:04,530
leadership position amongst the
private sector and least we take

2817
03:02:04,530 --> 03:02:09,240
the same action that we expect
of them will require government

2818
03:02:09,240 --> 03:02:14,100
agencies to measure and reduce
their emissions and if that

2819
03:02:14,130 --> 03:02:17,730
unable to achieve carbon
neutrality, they must have said,

2820
03:02:18,060 --> 03:02:24,240
Oh, there it is. If you can't do
it, you gotta pay. That's what

2821
03:02:24,240 --> 03:02:26,580
the offset means. This.

2822
03:02:29,100 --> 03:02:32,100
I had so much hope for people in
New Zealand.

2823
03:02:33,540 --> 03:02:37,560
It's just a bunch of sheep
farmers are getting hoodwinked.

2824
03:02:37,590 --> 03:02:38,580
hoodwinked.

2825
03:02:39,720 --> 03:02:44,790
20. Crap. 25. All right.

2826
03:02:48,060 --> 03:02:50,400
I do have I want to play for the
next show. I'm gonna tease it.

2827
03:02:50,610 --> 03:02:56,610
Okay. Jason Kenney. Oh, he's
great. The prime is the premier

2828
03:02:56,610 --> 03:03:02,250
of Alberta. Yeah. lays it into
the great reset. You don't you

2829
03:03:02,250 --> 03:03:04,680
don't want it you don't want to
play these now on today's Okay,

2830
03:03:04,680 --> 03:03:09,810
let's play. Okay, who tells it
like it? Is that what I saw?

2831
03:03:09,810 --> 03:03:13,470
This is almost like a podcast
he's doing. Like some somebody

2832
03:03:13,470 --> 03:03:16,440
is calling Shawn. He's answering
questions. Yeah, that's the

2833
03:03:16,440 --> 03:03:20,430
premiere. I think this is the
way to go. Just a call in show

2834
03:03:21,360 --> 03:03:22,680
any lead in for one?

2835
03:03:23,730 --> 03:03:27,000
No, but it's about the great
reset and is to conspiracy.

2836
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:29,520
Everyone kind of thinks to some
sort of conspiracy and he's just

2837
03:03:29,520 --> 03:03:31,980
debunking that and saying that
we're not doing any of this

2838
03:03:31,980 --> 03:03:35,430
crap. Alright. Ricky
Butterworth, or might be Cindy

2839
03:03:35,430 --> 03:03:38,820
Butterworth says, Where do you
stand on the great reset the

2840
03:03:38,820 --> 03:03:40,440
liberals are planning on
introducing.

2841
03:03:41,490 --> 03:03:45,180
Well, I let me just say that
first of all, what is this great

2842
03:03:45,180 --> 03:03:45,720
reset?

2843
03:03:48,810 --> 03:03:51,360
Pure Polly of the Federal
conservative finance critic

2844
03:03:51,360 --> 03:03:55,410
recently raised concerns about
this and then he was attacked by

2845
03:03:55,410 --> 03:03:57,780
some in the media and by the
liberals for supposedly

2846
03:03:57,780 --> 03:04:01,410
circulating conspiracy theories.
Well, the great reset is

2847
03:04:01,410 --> 03:04:05,850
actually the name of a book by a
very prominent advocate of it.

2848
03:04:05,850 --> 03:04:08,820
It's his name is Klaus Schwab,
he sent to see I guess, he said

2849
03:04:08,820 --> 03:04:11,130
one to every, probably every
government leader around the

2850
03:04:11,130 --> 03:04:18,720
world, and close Schwab's thesis
in his book is that we should

2851
03:04:18,720 --> 03:04:23,190
governments and societies the
world should, quote, seize the

2852
03:04:23,220 --> 03:04:29,250
opportunity of the public health
and economic crisis to reimagine

2853
03:04:29,250 --> 03:04:35,400
the world and radically change
policies. Now, in what ways I

2854
03:04:35,400 --> 03:04:39,360
would describe it as a grab bag
of left wing ideas for less

2855
03:04:39,360 --> 03:04:44,250
freedom and more government for
more government intervention for

2856
03:04:44,820 --> 03:04:50,130
policies that would I think,
create massive poverty is

2857
03:04:50,130 --> 03:04:54,150
particularly energy policy
policies that he is advocating

2858
03:04:54,150 --> 03:04:58,260
so close fall, by the way, is
the president and founder of the

2859
03:04:58,260 --> 03:04:59,970
World Economic Forum, also known

2860
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:03,960
As the Davos summit, I call it
the biggest gathering of global

2861
03:05:03,960 --> 03:05:07,110
hypocrites bags in history. It's
the

2862
03:05:08,160 --> 03:05:12,180
it's a little ski village in
Switzerland. And every I think

2863
03:05:12,180 --> 03:05:12,960
February,

2864
03:05:14,340 --> 03:05:20,130
a couple of thousand super rich
people, a lot of billionaires,

2865
03:05:20,130 --> 03:05:24,660
millionaires, global CEOs, and
politicians fly into Davos men

2866
03:05:24,960 --> 03:05:27,300
with hundreds of private
airplanes. They go into

2867
03:05:27,300 --> 03:05:30,150
Switzerland, and they spend a
week basically lecturing

2868
03:05:31,350 --> 03:05:34,980
the world including especially
working women and men, about how

2869
03:05:34,980 --> 03:05:39,300
they should reduce their carbon
footprint. The hypocrisy in that

2870
03:05:39,300 --> 03:05:43,770
crowd is is so thick you can't
even cut it with a knife. How

2871
03:05:43,770 --> 03:05:47,490
much power does this guy have as
the premier? He's basically a

2872
03:05:47,490 --> 03:05:51,330
governor like the governor get
the governor's Gavin Newsome

2873
03:05:51,330 --> 03:05:55,890
level? Well, pretty powerful.
Yeah, yeah, he's no slouch. Does

2874
03:05:55,890 --> 03:05:59,130
he also eat at the French
Laundry at the lift class

2875
03:05:59,130 --> 03:06:01,950
laundry, as they call it in
counter? navia? I don't know

2876
03:06:01,950 --> 03:06:04,530
what to do in Alberta, there
probably be a couple of cool

2877
03:06:04,530 --> 03:06:05,880
places in Edmonton.

2878
03:06:06,900 --> 03:06:08,730
Might be they're not sure. I
don't think they're shut down.

2879
03:06:08,730 --> 03:06:09,930
He's one of those guys. You
know, he's not

2880
03:06:11,430 --> 03:06:12,870
good. He's better than New
Zealand.

2881
03:06:14,550 --> 03:06:16,410
no comparison, this play part
two.

2882
03:06:17,490 --> 03:06:22,200
The hypocrisy in that crowd is
is so thick. You can't even cut

2883
03:06:22,200 --> 03:06:25,530
it with a knife. And so no, I'm
not going to be taking any

2884
03:06:26,610 --> 03:06:31,170
policy direction from Klaus
Schwab or his his ilk. And what

2885
03:06:31,170 --> 03:06:35,040
I find offensive Look, the so
called great reset. It's not a

2886
03:06:35,040 --> 03:06:40,590
conspiracy theory. It is a
actual set of concrete proposals

2887
03:06:40,830 --> 03:06:43,500
being advocated by some very
influential people, and

2888
03:06:43,500 --> 03:06:48,030
including apparently by Prime
Minister Trudeau, who's clearly

2889
03:06:48,060 --> 03:06:51,120
alluded to it referred to it
quoted from it, the Schwab

2890
03:06:51,120 --> 03:06:54,150
theory in a speech he gave to
the United Nations a couple of

2891
03:06:54,150 --> 03:06:56,820
months ago. So it's not a
conspiracy theory to talk about

2892
03:06:56,820 --> 03:07:00,750
that. Those are the folks
advocating it. And I think it's

2893
03:07:00,750 --> 03:07:03,690
perfectly legitimate for a
democratically elected leaders

2894
03:07:03,690 --> 03:07:09,420
for me to say, heck, no, we're
not going to exploit or take the

2895
03:07:10,260 --> 03:07:17,430
take advantage of a crisis to
advance a political agenda.

2896
03:07:19,020 --> 03:07:22,140
We're actually all in this
together. Like we keep saying,

2897
03:07:22,800 --> 03:07:27,120
then how about we focus on the
crisis on protecting lives and

2898
03:07:27,120 --> 03:07:29,820
livelihoods helping people get
through this?

2899
03:07:31,350 --> 03:07:37,440
And And how about after that,
instead of exploiting the crisis

2900
03:07:37,470 --> 03:07:40,980
to impose on democratic
societies a whole bunch of

2901
03:07:40,980 --> 03:07:46,950
social failed socialist policy
ideas? How about instead, we get

2902
03:07:46,950 --> 03:07:53,130
refocused on generating economic
growth, on recreating some of

2903
03:07:53,130 --> 03:07:55,530
the trillions of dollars of
wealth that will have been

2904
03:07:55,530 --> 03:07:59,400
destroyed. That restarting some
of the hundreds of thousands of

2905
03:07:59,400 --> 03:08:01,020
businesses that will have gone
under

2906
03:08:02,340 --> 03:08:05,640
of obsessively focusing on
getting the millions

2907
03:08:07,320 --> 03:08:10,710
10s of millions around the world
back to work. Those who have

2908
03:08:10,710 --> 03:08:14,820
suffered most in the COVID era
have been the poorest

2909
03:08:16,170 --> 03:08:19,380
around the world. And so the
notion that we would then drive

2910
03:08:19,380 --> 03:08:23,610
them further into energy poverty
through a close fobbs policy

2911
03:08:23,670 --> 03:08:26,970
agenda is I just, frankly, find
it offensive.

2912
03:08:28,020 --> 03:08:33,780
Very curious how this guy a got
elected and be still alive.

2913
03:08:34,350 --> 03:08:41,400
Well, he's in the rich province.
Okay. And it's oil rich. Ah,

2914
03:08:41,730 --> 03:08:45,870
birdie is for all practical
purposes. The Texas Yes, of

2915
03:08:45,870 --> 03:08:49,080
Canada. navia. Yes. Okay. Well,
of course, then he represents

2916
03:08:49,080 --> 03:08:52,380
his constituency very well. But
he might as well start learning

2917
03:08:52,380 --> 03:08:53,070
how to sing.

2918
03:08:54,450 --> 03:08:55,710
He better learn how to sing it.

2919
03:08:57,150 --> 03:08:58,440
Be on your free.

2920
03:09:04,050 --> 03:09:07,650
That's right. Everybody build
back better for someone else.

2921
03:09:08,220 --> 03:09:09,990
It's what they really want you
to do.

2922
03:09:11,190 --> 03:09:15,840
I think that's it. Yeah. No, I'm
done. I'm done. You're done.

2923
03:09:15,840 --> 03:09:18,480
We're all done. There is some
cool stuff to talk about on

2924
03:09:18,480 --> 03:09:21,450
Thursday, though. There's some
new OTG things I'd like to

2925
03:09:21,450 --> 03:09:27,210
discuss okie G, go and opkg also
needs to look at some of the

2926
03:09:27,210 --> 03:09:31,950
incoming Biden that cabinet
administration. Yes. As the

2927
03:09:31,950 --> 03:09:35,700
mainstream has, is shuffling us
right through there. We just

2928
03:09:35,700 --> 03:09:39,600
have to it's happening is what
it is. no going back should have

2929
03:09:39,600 --> 03:09:43,260
a betting pool on who's going to
be picked for what? Okay, we can

2930
03:09:44,010 --> 03:09:46,350
basically take a look at
everyone who's in Obama's

2931
03:09:46,350 --> 03:09:48,180
administration and figure out
where they're gonna put them.

2932
03:09:49,980 --> 03:09:53,310
Up next to no agenda stream.com
we've got the grumpy old Ben's

2933
03:09:53,310 --> 03:09:56,730
and I have a lot of submissions
but only two and a show mixes

2934
03:09:56,730 --> 03:09:59,520
for this show. Move the other
ones to Thursday. We have Tom

2935
03:09:59,520 --> 03:09:59,970
starkweather

2936
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:04,410
And Noah's archetype or Rick's,
I believe is how I pronounced

2937
03:10:04,410 --> 03:10:07,920
it. Coming to you from
opportunity opportunity zone 33

2938
03:10:07,920 --> 03:10:10,830
here in the capital of Jerome
Starr state Austin, Texas team,

2939
03:10:10,830 --> 03:10:13,560
reason number six and all the
governmental maps. Remember us

2940
03:10:13,560 --> 03:10:16,500
at the vorak.org slash na until
Thursday in the morning,

2941
03:10:16,500 --> 03:10:18,270
everybody. Oh, Hi, I'm Adam
Curry

2942
03:10:20,250 --> 03:10:20,790
in from

2943
03:10:22,320 --> 03:10:25,230
from Northern Silicon Valley
where we're supposedly shut down

2944
03:10:25,230 --> 03:10:28,590
but people seem to be driving
all over the place. I'm just, we

2945
03:10:28,590 --> 03:10:31,410
return on Thursday right here on
no agenda, remember us in the

2946
03:10:31,410 --> 03:10:37,020
vortex.org slash na until then
adios mofos and such.

2947
03:10:39,900 --> 03:10:48,030
I am counting absentee ballots
that Biden needs to win the

2948
03:10:48,060 --> 03:10:48,480
vote.

2949
03:10:52,590 --> 03:10:54,750
And there's no poll watchers in
this room.

2950
03:10:59,580 --> 03:11:07,890
For more hours to scan this pie
go but I am tempted to keep by

2951
03:11:07,890 --> 03:11:08,490
Dan

2952
03:11:12,420 --> 03:11:14,370
until he gets a disease and
resign.

2953
03:11:50,880 --> 03:11:51,510
Wow.

2954
03:11:53,400 --> 03:11:54,000
Wow.

2955
03:11:55,920 --> 03:11:56,400
Wow.

2956
03:12:07,980 --> 03:12:09,480
suitcase filled

2957
03:12:10,740 --> 03:12:14,790
with printed balanced scan No.

2958
03:12:26,730 --> 03:12:30,600
Well, it might be a
constitutional crisis

2959
03:12:31,710 --> 03:12:33,240
or just some changing of some.

2960
03:12:34,440 --> 03:12:35,460
But either way,

2961
03:12:38,970 --> 03:12:39,810
some

2962
03:12:49,080 --> 03:12:49,770
loss.

2963
03:13:07,710 --> 03:13:08,730
Why?

2964
03:13:12,690 --> 03:13:13,650
Why?

2965
03:13:18,150 --> 03:13:21,990
So what I've committed Fota for

2966
03:13:23,220 --> 03:13:27,990
it's hiding the quiet majority
Trump has

2967
03:13:37,680 --> 03:13:38,340
said say

2968
03:13:42,900 --> 03:13:43,890
I love you, Joe.

2969
03:13:47,010 --> 03:13:52,050
We're gathered here tonight.
You're a very important word.

2970
03:13:57,690 --> 03:13:58,530
Because I like you.

2971
03:14:00,450 --> 03:14:03,330
I like your President Trump won,
as we said,

2972
03:14:05,190 --> 03:14:08,040
and then Ohio. But we will still
win.

2973
03:14:14,520 --> 03:14:19,020
This election was rigged. Very
simply, you will decide whether

2974
03:14:19,020 --> 03:14:22,380
your children will show up in a
socialist country or whether

2975
03:14:22,380 --> 03:14:24,120
they will grow up in a free
country

2976
03:14:26,640 --> 03:14:28,020
trying to convince us that we

2977
03:14:30,720 --> 03:14:33,750
found a lot of balance that can
be nice.

2978
03:14:35,160 --> 03:14:38,670
And I felt so good. But I met
this guy and I met three of

2979
03:14:38,670 --> 03:14:38,880
them.

2980
03:14:56,250 --> 03:14:58,140
Buy a piece of machinery.
Remember that

2981
03:15:10,920 --> 03:15:12,630
I'm running when

2982
03:15:14,759 --> 03:15:17,609
I don't run the election. I
don't run to see if people are

2983
03:15:17,609 --> 03:15:21,329
walking in suitcases and putting
them under a table with a black

2984
03:15:21,329 --> 03:15:22,109
robe around

2985
03:15:34,290 --> 03:15:38,010
mopho.org slash and

2986
03:15:39,390 --> 03:15:40,710
you're like God you sound crazy.
No, no
