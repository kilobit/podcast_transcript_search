Valley where he had a gully
washer last night it's finally

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,950
raining no more fires. I'm Jesse
tomorrow.

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,510
Yeah, is it is it now also bad
weather there? Or is it just

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,520
just wet? I mean, is it like
horrible outside? Actually

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,010
today? Yeah, after they don't do
it. This is the series we've

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,440
seen this this weather in
California before where it rains

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,340
at night like crazy. And then
it's sunny and beautiful. Oh,

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,120
it's nice out it's cold. Cold
but it's pretty out and sunny.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,660
Yes. Layers were layers when you
go out children wear layers in

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,930
San Francisco. Now it's crazy.
Got so you got fun. I got some

17
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,470
rain. crappy weather on the
west. The East Coast is Whoo.

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,640
This is a good one.

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,360
A lot of snow falling. Yeah,
sounds like it. Which is good.

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,630
Yeah, everyone has a real reason
to stay home.

21
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,910
Do we have a Zephyr yet? Do you
see anything come by? I'm

22
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,000
waiting cuz I'm stoked man. Did
you see Bitcoin?

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,160
This is crazy. Right now is
23,600 by now

24
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,480
get in while stocks last
everybody. Now I don't know yet.

25
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,010
GM shirt comes Oh, here we go.

26
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:52,740
3456 770 which is actually
eight. What do you mean actually

27
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,210
eight? Well, ever since they
went to the three a week instead

28
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,920
of every day. Yeah, they took
out the male luggage car. Ah,

29
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,830
okay Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your official Zephyr report

30
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,830
we have a stable economy things
are moving along just nicely

31
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,370
alert the guy to Squawk Box CNBC
let them know that we have a

32
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,060
seven cars that for usually
eight minus the mail car and

33
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,330
Bitcoin 23,650

34
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,550
Oh my god.

35
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,270
Meanwhile, the course sells me
there's absolutely zero

36
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,160
correlation between the Zephyr
and Bitcoin. Honestly, you say

37
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,390
that's what you say card number
goes up.

38
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,250
My God. I don't know. I don't
know. Meanwhile, we're all here

39
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,550
in a farmer controlled
biosecurity state and enjoying

40
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,580
it very much because we've got a
vaccine

41
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,550
but I don't know if if it's hard
to tell now with the mainstream

42
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,050
I mean obviously vaccine is
their is their number one story.

43
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,420
But this hack by cozy bear

44
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:11,190
this Russian hack that got into
email systems, I mean, that's

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,530
you think that will be a big
story.

46
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,660
Well, I think they tried to make
it a big story but but the media

47
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,180
in fact, I have a clip I thought
yeah, this one here. And I added

48
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,270
listen to this clip and because
it's the vaccine clip this by

49
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,750
vaccine side effects clip Mm
hmm. I hate to even tell you how

50
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,130
this is on this list is s Vax.
Yeah, I got it. I found it. The

51
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,180
S for side effects is over in
front of the vaccine. It's

52
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,810
jumping around the left when you
type. It's that devora keyboard

53
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,170
you got to get used to it. And
so this is the vaccine report

54
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,070
from NBC and it is very
interesting the way it's

55
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,580
structured. It happened in
Juneau, Alaska. 10 minutes after

56
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,790
receiving the Pfizer vaccine
yesterday, a health care worker

57
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,510
rushed to the ER with a severe
rash and shortness of breath,

58
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:08,880
her heart rate was elevated and
she had a red flushed rash over

59
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,290
her face and torso.

60
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,270
I was concerned about an
anaplastic reaction so gave her

61
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,230
the standard treatment of a dose
of intramuscular epinephrine.

62
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,670
And she responded immediately.
After a night in the ICU

63
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,880
receiving more medications.
She's stable now. Doctors say

64
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,480
she had no known previous
allergies, unlike two people in

65
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,110
the UK, who also developed
severe allergic reactions.

66
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,280
Tonight caution from Dr. Fauci.
If you have a history of a

67
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,660
severe allergic reaction, you
should either not take this

68
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,610
vaccine or if you do take it,
take it in the context of a

69
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,960
place where if you do develop an
allergic reaction, it could be

70
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,100
readily and effectively treated.
But 10s of 1000s of medical

71
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,160
workers have already been
vaccinated this week, most

72
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,970
reporting noses

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,300
effects like nursing director
Johnny Leonard at Methodist

74
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,780
Hospital in Houston, slept had a
great night last night woke up

75
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,640
this morning. She was going to
work, no symptoms at all.

76
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,380
Feeling very normal.

77
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,080
Through tomorrow 886 locations
will have received Pfizer doses.

78
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,860
vaccinations already starting in
nursing homes tomorrow and

79
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,610
outside FDA advisory panel will
decide whether to also authorize

80
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,080
Madonna's vaccine, if approved,
as expected, 6 million doses

81
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,070
could ship next week. Tom
Costello, NBC News, Washington.

82
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,550
Okay, what did you find
particularly odd about that?

83
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,520
Well, they started off with this
blast and you said they weren't

84
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,220
covering the Russian thing, or
that Russian Russians

85
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,360
various hack mysterious Oh, from
the, from the Snowden days that

86
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,110
you can make everything look
Russian according to the schemes

87
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,020
they have. So you can make
anything look a Russian attack

88
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,940
could be from anyone. And

89
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,020
I realized when I listen to this
thing a couple times, oh,

90
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,740
apparently these guys are on
Easy Street with this vaccine.

91
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,580
And they're not coughing up too
good for the advertising on NBC.

92
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,180
Ah,

93
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,360
there you go. That No, that
makes sense. It makes nothing

94
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,240
but sense they do this little
you know, we can you know, it's

95
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,870
Pfizer guy. You guys haven't
been you guys aren't up to your

96
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,710
normal pay out here for you
advertising What's going on? You

97
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,220
know, we can run a lot of these
that we can run nothing but

98
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,300
horror stories about the
vaccine. Yes. You know, in in

99
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,440
that context.

100
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,530
A lot of clips I got, which are
short ones. kind of explain the

101
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,130
context of these clips like this
one. Is there a difference

102
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,850
between modernas and the one out
from Pfizer, Dr. Ashish Shah of

103
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,270
Brown University tells ABC from
an efficacy safety point of view

104
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,810
there, they're nearly identical.
one's a little bit easier to

105
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,000
distribute doesn't have to be
kept frozen. That's the maternal

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,300
one. I doubt most people will
have a choice and it shouldn't

107
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,910
really matter. They're about the
same once it gets into your arm.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,760
And Wednesday was the deadliest
day of the pandemic to date with

109
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,560
3656 American deaths according
to Johns Hopkins University.

110
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,040
So that's kind of like hey,
which one of you guys gonna

111
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,760
advertise Madonna Pfizer? I
don't know. I'd like to in the

112
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,910
arm though, that always makes me
feel good. Oh, the old stick

113
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,240
that in your arm at Bill Gates
though. This is this is the this

114
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,220
is the problem is the goalposts
are being moved. And we've seen

115
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,880
this happen throughout the past
10 months, where we start with

116
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,330
flatten the curve. Remember that
I even foolishly thought, oh,

117
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,600
April 7, we'll be done with
this. But now, since this is

118
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,590
apparently part of the big
reset, which in my mind can only

119
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,030
be now that we're shutting down
again, globally, can only be to

120
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,120
completely bankrupt the
economies. The economy is small

121
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,230
business, keep the big ones
open, especially the service

122
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:02,700
sector. Everybody invested
heavily to be able to weather

123
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,850
the dark winter and now Screw
you. We're just closing it down.

124
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,110
So that's done. That's that's
clearly what it's for. But now,

125
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,230
after being promised life, we'll
get back to normal after we get

126
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:18,060
the vaccine. Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, that's not how

127
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,370
it's going to work. No, because
it was every single human being

128
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,090
on the planet is vaccinated.
You'll be wearing a mask Stan

129
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,510
home life lock downs and Bill
Gates went on CNN with Jake

130
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:35,160
Tapper to communicate to the
slaves to get my nation. When do

131
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,600
you think life will fully return
to what we thought of as normal?

132
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:45,960
Back in January, no masks, no
social distancing? No other

133
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,880
protective measures necessary.

134
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,990
Certainly by the summer will be
way closer to normal than we are

135
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,670
now. This laughs He does
irritates me a lot in this

136
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,990
particular clip. Why does he
have to laugh when he's giving

137
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,640
us really bad news. If we follow
it, life will get back to

138
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:08,940
normal.

139
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,460
No other protective measures.
This horrible, certainly by the

140
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:24,360
summer will be way closer to
normal than we are now. But even

141
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,100
through early 2022, unless we
help other countries get rid of

142
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,580
this disease and we get high
vaccination rates in our

143
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,810
country. The risk of
reintroduction will be there and

144
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,340
of course, the global economy
will be slowed down which hurts

145
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,840
America economically. In a
pretty dramatic way, too. We'll

146
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,200
have starting the summer about
nine months where a few things

147
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,730
like big public gatherings

148
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,400
will still be restricted. But
you know we can see now that

149
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,000
somewhere between 12 to 18
months and we have a change

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,370
Can we manage it? Well, to get
back to normal? And, oh, if we

151
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,430
manage it well, well, of course,
we'll, we'll mess it up Dr.

152
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,200
Bill, we know that.

153
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,470
But luckily, the vaccine is
here. So, stick with it, people,

154
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,200
it's still rolling out. More
than 30 million people in

155
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,800
California are right now under
brand new stay at home orders as

156
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,120
hospitals, their risk being
overwhelmed. There are a lot of

157
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,680
governors who oppose bringing
back these lockdown orders and

158
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,550
forcing businesses to close.
What do you think? Do you think

159
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,460
more states need to consider
taking that kind of drastic

160
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,640
action and the kind of drastic
action we saw when the pandemic

161
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,660
first began? Or can there be a
more nuanced approach? Well,

162
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,370
certainly mask wearing has
essentially no downside. They're

163
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,090
not expensive. bars and
restaurants in most of the

164
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,420
country will be closed as we go
into this way, then I think,

165
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,380
sadly, that's appropriate,
depending on how severe it is.

166
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,440
The decision about schools is
much more complicated because

167
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,950
there you know, the benefits are
pretty high. The amount of

168
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,820
transmission is not the same as
in restaurants and bars, so

169
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,530
it's all correct crap is
bullcrap. There's nothing going

170
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,220
on with restaurants and bars,
asking any restaurant or well,

171
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,540
bar, okay, Austin has some bar
issues, but restaurants, there's

172
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,890
no one that getting COVID in
restaurants, and Gavin nuisance

173
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,980
health official, what's the
guy's name?

174
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:39,240
golly, I guess he spelled it out
playing out. And oh, this is not

175
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,290
about not about people getting
infected at restaurants. Oh, no.

176
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:49,050
So the decision to include among
other sectors, outdoor dining,

177
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,040
and limiting that turning to
restaurants to deliver and

178
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,640
provide takeout options,
instead, really has to do with

179
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:02,010
the goal of trying to keep
people at home, not a comment on

180
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,300
the relative safety of outdoor
dining. And we have worked hard

181
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,980
with that industry to create
safer ways for outdoor dining to

182
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,050
happen to keeping tables farther
apart to ensuring masking

183
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,220
happens as much as possible to
create opportunities for air

184
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,990
circulation to continue. All of
those factors make sectors like

185
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,500
outdoor dining, lower risk. But
right now, with the levels of

186
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,710
transmission that we're seeing,
we advise against anything that

187
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,700
you can do in another way in a
lower risk way. that avoids you

188
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,770
either leaving your home or only
leaving your home in a way that

189
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,970
doesn't expose you and cause you
to mix with others. Right. So it

190
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,110
has nothing to do with
infectivity at restaurants. It's

191
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,520
just oh, you we don't want you
to have anything to do. So stay

192
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,290
home or go through the drive
thru. And with, as I suspected

193
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,640
with most of these public health
officials, they're just reading

194
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,150
the script. If you haven't seen
this, this is a hot my colleague

195
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:11,340
Mike hot Mike, from Ontario,
Canada's top health officials

196
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,150
just before they're about to do
one of their COVID updates and

197
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,780
briefings. I don't know why I
bring all these papers and never

198
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,080
look at

199
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:21,900
the numbers I do.

200
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,630
I just say whatever they write
down for me.

201
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,050
And we're sure that's true.

202
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,120
Yes, I just say whatever they
write down for me, oh, why? Why

203
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,870
would I do anything tough like
that. So the world is locking

204
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:45,390
down again. We have UK down
tight. And now we're talking

205
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,250
well into January. But the
people are getting somewhat

206
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,980
restless. And they're a little
tired of it. And this was a

207
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,690
great example, as the
Netherlands locked down on I

208
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,370
want to say Monday for five
weeks. I mean, tight, this is

209
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,870
locked down. You can't really
have you can go out you can go

210
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,900
to work if your work is allowed
to have you. But now basically

211
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,630
everyone's locked down. It's
done. So the Dutch Prime

212
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,740
Minister, he comes on live TV to
announce this and this comes

213
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,240
from the tower which we call the
door engine, which is in a way

214
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,970
equivalent to the Oval Office of
the Netherlands that he sit in

215
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:29,280
there. And the tower overlooks a
rather wide moat. It's a canal

216
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,480
but believe me it's meant to be
a moat. To keep the plebes away.

217
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,680
The plebs to the plebs are away
on the other side of this moat.

218
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,940
And they're so loud with their
booing and mainly whistling

219
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,240
which is always meant as an
insult in the Netherlands is you

220
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,660
know, if you ever watch a
football game soccer when they

221
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,950
whistle that's disapproval. They
could not drown out the sound of

222
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,210
people disapproving of what the
prime minister was saying. Have

223
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,970
a listen only to their cameras.

224
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,990
Nothing it's got to

225
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,420
pull it out

242
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,860
it might be kind of annoying if
people are doing that all day

243
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,640
and all night.

244
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:18,000
But it's people are not really
happy with this. And in the UK,

245
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,470
they see ahead this

246
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,890
they've come up with something
new to justify this lockdown,

247
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:30,270
which a lot of people are saying
it's not based on science and I

248
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,750
tend to agree. Here's the health
secretary of the UK.

249
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,160
Matt Hancock, I'd like to update
the house on a new development

250
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,300
about the virus itself. Over the
last few days, thanks to our

251
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,160
world class genomic capability
in the UK, we have identified a

252
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,510
new variant of Coronavirus,
which may be associated with the

253
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,700
fastest spread in the southeast
of England.

254
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,280
initial analysis suggests that
this variant is growing faster

255
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,060
than the existing variants.
We've currently identified over

256
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,300
1000 cases with this variant
predominantly in the south of

257
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,410
England. Although cases have
been identified in nearly 60

258
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,920
different local authority areas,
and numbers are increasing

259
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,670
rapidly. Similar variants have
been identified in other

260
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,090
countries over the last few
months. We've notified the World

261
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,540
Health Organization about this
new variant and Public Health

262
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,020
England is working hard to
continue its expert analysis at

263
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,310
Porton down. Mr. Speaker, I must
stress this point that there is

264
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,220
currently nothing to suggest
that this variant is more likely

265
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,700
to cause serious disease. And
the latest clinical advice is

266
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,000
that it's highly unlikely that
this mutation would fail to

267
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,540
respond to a vaccine. But it
shows we've got to be vigilant,

268
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,140
follow the rules. And everyone
needs to take personal

269
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,970
responsibility not to spread
this virus. It is so bad in the

270
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,680
UK. And just everybody I know
who had a business is bankrupt.

271
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,160
Done.

272
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:06,420
Yes. It's not really funny. This
it's done that just completely

273
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,490
got there's nothing left. And
and this latest lockdown, which

274
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,920
I don't understand other than

275
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,690
you know, let's just scare
everybody and ruin everything.

276
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,320
It makes no sense. The numbers
aren't there. Although, you

277
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,490
know, now that the CDC has Ace
numbers are there Yes. But CDC

278
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:32,310
has combined the death numbers
with influenza and

279
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:38,160
pneumonia. So you have I think
it's p IC. Well, that's not

280
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,940
right. Well, that's how they
come up with a 3000 dead in one

281
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,660
day. Because people are dying
while they're dying of a lot of

282
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,290
things. It's just it's we
forgotten to question it. That's

283
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,580
That's how horrible this brain
programming has been this mind

284
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,300
control.

285
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,340
It's just crazy. Anyway, so
we've got the vaccine coming

286
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,330
out. And you know, the, the mind
control remains strong with

287
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,260
everybody on television. I love
this, this one America news guy

288
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,860
who was a total nerd. And when
he when he finally figures out

289
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,470
what he did here, he'll hate
himself for joining us now for

290
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,770
further analysis on this moment
is Adam glut. He's the president

291
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,830
of the media watchdog group
accuracy media. So, Adam, I want

292
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,110
to start with the Coronavirus,
actually because today we saw a

293
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,080
major development the
Coronavirus being shipped out to

294
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,140
frontline workers vulnerable
populations as well. It's really

295
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,950
a miraculous achievement within
itself. It's miraculous just

296
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,350
ship out the virus ship it out.

297
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,410
Did you even hear it? Yeah, you
know I can I can almost it's

298
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,070
almost unfathomable how often
this happens. Well, this is

299
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,710
truth wanting to come
documenting this for for a

300
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,540
month. Listen to this next one.
This is the first black nurse to

301
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,130
get the COVID vaccine.

302
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,810
Because there were a lot of
propaganda, a lot of promotion

303
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,000
of this on television as you
pointed out but

304
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,120
But we're not quite sure who's
going to spend the dollars. So

305
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,060
yeah, there was a lot of Oh, USA
Today had

306
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,890
a great article, or they say,
you know, there are some side

307
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,370
effects, you know, you might
blink with one eye slower than

308
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,570
you blink with the other eye,
you may lose control of some of

309
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,780
your facial muscle muscles,
which is temporary Bell's palsy.

310
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,750
But it's really not that bad. I
mean, that's in the USA Today

311
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,410
must have gotten in on some ad
by early. So now we're trying to

312
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,100
push it to the black and brown
communities and listen to what

313
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,280
this nurse says, and how and
when did you get selected to be

314
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,700
the very first in line? And why
was it important for you to do

315
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:45,180
so in public? So I volunteered
to take the vaccine, ever since

316
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,600
they were talks of a vaccine,
I've been telling my friends and

317
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,700
family, my colleagues that when
this does come to fruition that

318
00:20:53,730 --> 00:21:00,270
I would be first in line, I
trust the science. And so it's

319
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:04,950
important for me to lead by
example, what I don't trust is

320
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,880
how I will be affected by COVID
backs COVID-19.

321
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,810
The whole point of the
interview, is to make black and

322
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:20,220
brown communities feel
comfortable about taking the

323
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,780
vaccine and then is how I will
be affected by COVID Max

324
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:29,550
COVID-19. Row. That's okay.
We'll have lots of black

325
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,400
celebrities coming to the
rescue. Dana bash knows all

326
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,000
about it.

327
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,960
What do you want to see from the
political figures in addition to

328
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,590
public health figures that
people are looking to for

329
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,040
answers and that people across
the country who might be

330
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,780
skeptical of the vaccine trust.

331
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,210
So I think there's an awful lot
of misinformation out there

332
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,940
about this vaccine, we're
hearing a lot of anti Vax

333
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,570
propaganda being turned into
talking points by people on both

334
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,990
sides of the political spectrum.
I would love to see politicians

335
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,250
from both sides, showing up
getting vaccinated, doing the

336
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,090
vaccine on TV on whatever
network is the most, of course,

337
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,090
I'd love to see them on CNN
getting vaccinated, but that

338
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,970
will help prove to the American
public that this is a

339
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,420
trustworthy vaccine, that if
they themselves see it as safe

340
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,840
and are willing to inject it in
their bodies, so should be

341
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,350
American on the street. I think
it's important also for

342
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,080
celebrities to do it. Yes,
particularly.

343
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,420
Celebrities, many, many
celebrities in their community

344
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,420
hero, we know that there's more
mistrust of the vaccine from

345
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,840
minority groups appropriately.
So it's important for us to

346
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,440
shift that I'd love to see Trump
and Pence get vaccinated just as

347
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,890
I'd love to see them wear masks.
Yeah, we want to see lots of

348
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,490
celebrities vaccinated with the
real vaccine. Not the phony

349
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,430
baloney stuff Barack Obama is
going to get and Mike Pence is

350
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,700
going to get and this brings me
to Tom Cruise.

351
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:05,340
Talking of the of the media
industry in Hollywood, which as

352
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:10,080
you know is completely owned by
China, the Chinese Communist

353
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,850
Party. I'll do the report and at
first I read this the wrong way

354
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,150
actually and the keeper she sent
me straight and I think to turn

355
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,150
out to be spot on with her
analysis. Listen to the report

356
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,110
from ABC.

357
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,550
This good this is Good Morning
America. Thanks so

358
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,040
listen to the Tom Cruise report.
Tom Cruise reportedly let his

359
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,220
COVID concerns be heard loud and
clear while filming the new

360
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,950
mission impossible movie in
England in an audio obtained

361
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,100
from the sun tabloid, which has
not been authenticated by abc

362
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,280
news crews was reportedly
furious with staffers for

363
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,990
ignoring safety protocols.

364
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,920
Work on the film had to be shut
down in October when 12 staffers

365
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,760
tested positive. I don't know
much of let's put this I have

366
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,650
not met Tom Cruise. But I do
know his former handlers if you

367
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,160
recall, we had the
Scientologists PR team living in

368
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,610
Austin.

369
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:30,900
And for this audio to get out.
Ah, that is not how Tom Cruise

370
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,080
or the Church of Scientology
works. They would be they are

371
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,190
extremely litigious. They would
be blocking this they would be

372
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:43,110
hammering this they would be
threatening any new station that

373
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,020
was putting this on the air,
maybe even calling it hack

374
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,770
materials but this was intended
to come out and if you listen to

375
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:53,820
that, I think the whole thing is
four or five minutes. My boy is

376
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:57,900
acting that is Tom Cruise acting
mad in every single movie you've

377
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,000
seen him act Madden as it first

378
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,320
He acts mad at first I thought,
Oh, he's not acting when he's

379
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,940
mad is just how he is. And then
Tina said, No, no, no, he's

380
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,560
going to get praised for this.
And yes, if you look at the the

381
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,370
Hollywood celebrities, they're
all like, Oh, yes. So right on.

382
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,570
Good job, Tom. You tell them
it's important because you are

383
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,020
you're you're keeping families
fed and you're keeping 1000s of

384
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,010
people at work. You're saving
the industry, which is China's

385
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:34,440
industry because they need
product. That's why not because

386
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,480
Tom Cruise gives a crap about
anybody in America. Disgusting

387
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:44,010
PR pro Hollywood, which is good.
Yeah, I never I just kind of

388
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,890
glossed that whole thing over I
never but now as you mentioned

389
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,120
it Yeah. Is it any is a good
actor Sure. He doesn't This is

390
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,290
his show his chops that much. So
he's acting You're right. Yeah,

391
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:58,140
he's so he's acting and this was
all about somebody not wearing a

392
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,340
mask or some stupid thing.
whatever it was. Yeah, yeah.

393
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,630
Someone broke the COVID rules.
Now did give us a number of good

394
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:10,950
ISOs to choose from possibly for
the end of show. So here's one

395
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,250
that's not good. How about this
one?

396
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,660
We have this one. bucket hold on
hold on. Oh, maybe this one.

397
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,410
I like producers.

398
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,850
And the final one I have no How
about this one? How about this

399
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,030
one?

400
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,850
Yeah, Sue Bumi. You're right. We
are the gold standard which

401
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,670
would have been good. It's just
too booming but you want to hear

402
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:42,060
a couple of mine while you were
first is an aside Yeah, sure.

403
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,740
Okay, this is a head so small.

404
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:56,310
So small. Why is this so small?
zatz pretty good. I liked that.

405
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,280
Wait a minute. We're doing an IC
o off How about this one?

406
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,700
buck, buck. I can't help it.
It's all buckety this what you

407
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,400
get from the news? This is very
good. I like the head so small.

408
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,150
Do you have any others? The only
other one is I have is a screech

409
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,090
that I picked off him off some
something I was clipping

410
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,200
now I think

411
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,740
it was it again. head so small.

412
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,020
Yeah, I think that's the one we
put in the spot. Why is this? so

413
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,110
small? Yeah. No, I think I think
you nailed it with that one.

414
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,890
That's a really good one. Well,
there's also one last one. Oh,

415
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,630
I just noticed that this this is
Kaylee. I have a Kaylee special

416
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:43,980
today. Oh, nice. After a break
would do it. A lot of clips.

417
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:51,060
Yeah, a fact fact check cailli
fact check. Back check false.

418
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,610
I think head so small is better.
Yeah, I think it is too. I liked

419
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:01,170
it. I liked the fact check
false, but not for this. Just in

420
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:06,210
time for the vaccine. The World
Health Organization has released

421
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,790
an important directive regarding

422
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:14,160
this is for IBD users. This
would be the tech technicians

423
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:22,260
who performed the PCR quote
test. And they are now saying

424
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:22,770
that

425
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,020
the purpose of this notice to
ensure users of certain nucleic

426
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,740
acid testing technologies are
aware of certain aspects of the

427
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,850
instructions for use the ifu for
all products description of

428
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,610
problem. World Health
Organization has received user

429
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,050
feedback on an elevated risk for
false SARS cov. Two results when

430
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:48,780
testing specimens using RT PCR
reagents on open systems. Oh

431
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,410
wow. And now so what they say in
this is you really need to make

432
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,830
sure you follow the directions
carefully because you know you

433
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,300
could be doing it wrong.

434
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,470
And they literally say here.

435
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:08,190
The design principle of PCR
means for patients with high

436
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,830
levels of circulating virus
relatively few cycles will be

437
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,470
needed to detect virus and so
the count value will be low.

438
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,890
Conversely, when specimens
return a high count value means

439
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,290
that many cycles were required
to detect the virus in some

440
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,080
circumstances, the distinction
between background noise and

441
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,350
actual presence of the target
virus is difficult to ascertain.

442
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,630
So they say please check your
cycles which in my mind means

443
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,050
lower the site calls we got the
vaccine

444
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:40,080
but not too much, jack. That's
exactly what it means. Yeah.

445
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:47,700
My comb was tested positive
according to one of these PCR

446
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,680
things so he's social
distancing, or whatever. Okay,

447
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,000
quarantine him.

448
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:59,490
Lock him up New York Times
pushing the freedom pass app.

449
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:03,899
Which now the ethics of that are
being discussed and it seems to

450
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:08,519
be totally ethical. So that's
good. That's good. Good on San

451
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:11,459
Diego, everybody. This is great.
I think we should try this in

452
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:15,119
Austin. I think this is a legal
loophole that can be used the

453
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:19,559
county releasing that late in
response to this judge's ruling.

454
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:23,099
And today in court, the lawyers
representing these two strip

455
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:26,279
clubs, they argued that if
people were allowed to shop and

456
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:30,239
things like shopping malls and
grocery stores, then live adult

457
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:33,629
entertainment should also be
allowed to continue indoors. But

458
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,909
what many did not know is that
ruling will also begin to

459
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:43,919
encompass all of San Diego
County's restaurants. We got the

460
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,359
yellow rose here in Austin.

461
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,920
It can be Wait a minute, you
tell Oh, that's right. This is

462
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,350
where all the the right wingers
like the pitcher button, I think

463
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,080
is a legitimate complaint, which
is that they leave the strip

464
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,830
clubs out, but you can't go to a
restaurant. Hmm. So now in San

465
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:04,110
Diego, that's sticking in San
Diego restaurant. stripper and I

466
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,720
yeah, now you're talking Yes,
Ripper in every restaurant.

467
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,610
That's the ticket, baby. That's
the way to go. Yeah, just put a

468
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,360
pole up.

469
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,440
Just like to go go days when
they just have a girl in a cage.

470
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,810
Or you can even get one of those

471
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,730
trans people who read library
books to children.

472
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,410
Bring them in? Yeah, well, that
would probably make people lose

473
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,990
their appetite. So that's
different. I don't know. I mean,

474
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:38,040
it doesn't matter as long as we
get around it. Well do whatever

475
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,530
works. By the way. You said Get
your poll up, which was pretty

476
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:40,830
good.

477
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,350
Yeah, get your poll up people.

478
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:52,500
Now there is some other breaking
news, which was broken by

479
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,120
Politico. And, you know, now
there's documents which have

480
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,210
been declassified or leaked, I'm
not quite sure how they got

481
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,400
ahold of them didn't read the
whole story, because I caught

482
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,710
chris hayes talking about this.

483
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,050
And that there was discussion
early on. Amidst the team. It's

484
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,980
not clear who said what exactly
but doesn't matter. It's people

485
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,650
familiar with the thinking and
the matter. And they have some

486
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:21,240
documents, that the whole plan
was to get everybody infected,

487
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,020
just let them go and get
infected. For that stupid

488
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,500
debunked herd immunity theory,
which, by the way, I think is

489
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,250
the whole theory of vaccine
vaccination strategy. But okay.

490
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:37,110
And Chris Hayes gunked. Up,
Chris Hayes took it to another

491
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,680
level. Good evening from New
York. I'm Chris Hayes. We want

492
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,580
them infected. Those are the
words of a top Trump appointee,

493
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,150
directing the federal government
to pursue an intentional

494
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:53,010
strategy from the top down to
get as many Americans as sick as

495
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:57,750
possible in an attempt at so
called herd immunity. It's a

496
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:02,250
strategy we have seen unfold
before our eyes. We've talked

497
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,040
about it here on the show. It's
been apparent to all of us

498
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,300
reporting on this and watching.
But we now have the smoking gun

499
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:13,260
evidence, emails obtained by
Politico, in which the very

500
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:17,310
people at the center of this say
what exactly they were doing,

501
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:23,400
that they wanted people to get
the virus. And this is the

502
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,000
result.

503
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,240
The National Cathedral in
Washington DC last night, it's

504
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,640
Bell totaling 300 times, one
ring of the bell for every 1000

505
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:47,550
Americans as we pass the 300,000
death toll. According to the

506
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:52,920
COVID for tracking project, we
lost another 3400 Americans that

507
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,950
have died since roughly when
those bells rang just last

508
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,520
night. And that is a new Daily
Record. We never seen it before.

509
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,170
No country has 3400 Americans
lost to the virus in just the

510
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,400
last 24 hours.

511
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:10,680
And it did not have to be this
bad. Okay. Yeah, there you go.

512
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,790
Didn't have to be I love the
death toll clock. That's great.

513
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,910
Do they know they won the
election? It doesn't have this

514
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:23,100
this idea of just, well, me this
battle is mismanaged. blabbity

515
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:27,630
blabbity blah, is they can they
get let that go? No, they can't,

516
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:31,710
because we have too much noise
out there. We have to

517
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:36,360
continuously bash this
administration. Because, you

518
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,850
know, they're still trying to
stay in, by the way. Well, you

519
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:42,030
don't hear a lot of I think
that's really the most

520
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:46,200
remarkable from the mainstream
these days. You don't hear a lot

521
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,080
of Well, we're gonna have to get
the military to kick him out.

522
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,550
Why is that? all he's doing is
saying I want I'm not leaving,

523
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,530
but I don't hear that anymore. I
don't hate I don't hear the Oh,

524
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,970
yo we have to have to go

525
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,080
With the with the military, to
smoke them out, shoot them out

526
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,350
whatever they were talking. I
don't think that I think maybe

527
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:12,000
it was getting offensive or
please. They know. They know

528
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,620
that the military is not their
side is what I'd say. Now let's

529
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,410
let's look at a little bit of
what the military was never on

530
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,050
their side when they first came
to the thing was just a meme.

531
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,990
They like to propagate, they get
the dummies to vote for Biden.

532
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,950
So they're not worried about it
now, or they never were? I guess

533
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,520
not huh?

534
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,100
Well, good, good.

535
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,300
Let's take it from the top only
a few things on what's happening

536
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,930
with the with the executive
order enacting of that or not.

537
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:44,310
So we'll run through it. And I
don't do you have anything on

538
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:44,760
this?

539
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:48,810
Any clips or anything? COVID?
No, no, I'm done with COVID we

540
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:52,290
got nothing left. You got she
got some from COVID I don't

541
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,520
think get anything from COVID.

542
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,050
I'm looking at a vitamin d3
study that might be worthwhile.

543
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,050
Well, that's kind of
interesting. This is a part of a

544
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:04,110
series of these things are all
scattered around YouTube by

545
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:08,430
various experts. And you know,
the profit with the d3 thing is

546
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,560
that people don't get any
numbers.

547
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:16,020
So the dual take a you know, 500
unit, d3 and think that's gonna

548
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,990
do something. And so this was an
interesting one. This guy talks

549
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:22,170
about d3. And it's, it's very
effective and keeping you from

550
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:26,100
getting COVID apparently. And I
said, apparently, that's one

551
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,580
Hold on. I also, you know,
Christina had a little COVID

552
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:34,320
scare, as she and two friends of
hers were feeling really weak

553
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,890
that migraines like okay, well,
you either have some flu bug or

554
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:42,030
you got the Rona. So they got
tested, which was dramatic

555
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,210
seeing as you you can't go
anywhere, you can't travel on

556
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:45,450
the

557
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:51,720
public transit transit to get to
a test with all these rules.

558
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:58,050
And, you know, so I, I was kinda
like, oh, man, I hope that

559
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,440
doesn't, nothing gets worse. So
I'm contacting Agent Orange,

560
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,080
and, you know, a couple of guys,
and hey, you know, if I need any

561
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,170
help on there, and they got back
to me military now is

562
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,740
recommending, even if you if you
have the symptoms, even if

563
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:16,590
you're right in the middle of it
doesn't matter. 12,000 micro use

564
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,760
of d3 a day?

565
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:23,040
Well, I've been looking at all
these things, and that's within

566
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,340
the range of some of their
theories than the average one

567
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:33,150
that I've heard them recommend.
is eight a day. 8000 terms of

568
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,620
Yeah, a day every day. But
that's, you know, again, we

569
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:41,670
don't give this advice out. But
we can play clips. Yes. We love

570
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:47,610
playing clips. Now. Just d3 is
not a vitamin, correct? It turns

571
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:50,700
out that when you really analyze
is it's kind of a hormone. Yeah,

572
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,760
that's what I heard too, that
it's Yes. It's really it's for

573
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,240
mamak Yes, it is not, not
really. But it's very different

574
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,330
from D two, for example. Yeah.
And you know, you how you make a

575
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,720
hormone. Oh, yeah. I've made
many more Mayer. You don't?

576
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,510
Yeah. Oh, okay.

577
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,460
Yeah.

578
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,930
You are the worst divorce wreck.

579
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,510
Okay, let's replay recent
vitamin d3 study. The most

580
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:23,070
recent study that's come out
though, was India titled short

581
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,920
term high dose vitamin D
supplementation for COVID-19

582
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,980
disease, a randomized placebo
controlled trial. This is also

583
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:34,680
known as the shade study. And
here, they looked at 40 COVID-19

584
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,690
positive patients and here they
gave 60,000 units daily for

585
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:44,730
seven days. And they gave 24
patients placebo. So the total

586
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:48,270
here was 16. Got the
intervention. 24 controls got

587
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,940
the placebo. And in terms of
their outcomes, they were

588
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,900
looking at how many of them were
SARS COVID to negative by day

589
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,340
21. And whether any biomarker
reductions and so the results

590
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:06,720
were that 62.5% versus 20.8%.
Were SARS COVID to negative by

591
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,650
day 21. In the intervention
group and those that got vitamin

592
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,090
D. Yeah.

593
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:19,950
Yeah, yay for vitamin D, d3, d3,
d3, d3. Yeah. Yay. Yay for that.

594
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:23,220
Well, you know, I've been using
that as a method ever since you

595
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,580
told me about it years and years
and years ago on the show, and

596
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,660
it's always done well by me.
Yeah, I've been using it for

597
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:37,050
over 10 years now and I have not
had a cold. And I only had a I

598
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:41,430
had a close call with the 2017
deaths. flu. Yes, which I did

599
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:45,120
pick up in London. I took the
d3. But I took I also jumped on

600
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,630
the

601
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:52,800
Tamiflu, and I ended it with a
minor case of the flu. Yeah. And

602
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:57,090
except for that I have had not
had a cold flu anything. A

603
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:00,000
decade. Nice to note that the
American Medical system

604
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,260
Association has reversed their
position on hydroxychloroquine.

605
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,080
Now that Trumps out, yeah, they
rescinded their request, the

606
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,790
doctors stop prescribing it. So
that's all good now and I even

607
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:19,230
read, there was a study about
some, I think they actually use

608
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:24,660
bleach as the term but
disinfectant being injected and

609
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,960
working. There's all these
different things that you know,

610
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:32,880
we're just reason to laugh at
the president. That's crazy.

611
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:37,170
That's crazy. Well, what else do
you expect? Okay, so let me give

612
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:40,800
you an overview of what I'm
tracking with Trump's last

613
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,990
stand. Clearly, I also have some
thoughts on what to fail with.

614
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,490
Yeah, what the fail I'm sorry,
how, how this whole thing fell

615
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:54,690
apart. But so I don't know if
it's falling apart. But I'll

616
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,040
tell you what I was seeing and
I.

617
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:01,290
Well, the legal thing is
totally, but I don't even know

618
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:04,650
if that was the plan here.
Here's your here's where we're

619
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:08,280
at. And this is a combination of
me analyzing what I love for

620
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,740
this all to happen. Yeah, you
bet. I wouldn't. I think you

621
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,850
would, too. But is it going to
happen? I'm very strong 1000s of

622
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,160
sealed indictments feeling at
this moment.

623
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:19,770
But

624
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,870
we're in this interesting
position, where people aren't

625
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:30,810
even talking about Trump winning
or losing anymore. And I'm

626
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:37,500
talking about alternative media,
podcasts, blogs, YouTubers, but

627
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,780
also Newsmax Bannon, one
American news, America's voice.

628
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,710
I've been watching it all for
you. So I'm deeply embedded in

629
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:51,960
this. And the basic thinking is
it's not about it's not about

630
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,080
Trump, it's about having fair
elections. If we don't figure

631
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,690
out what happened with this one
will net we've lost the

632
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:01,020
Republic, we can never have a
fair election again. If we don't

633
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,870
understand we don't get to the
bottom of everything that

634
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:10,500
happened. And alongside of that
comes the no I'm not on 4chan

635
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,490
troll room. I don't do that
comes with something you keep

636
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:19,740
hearing. Well, the military and
the president both swore an oath

637
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,550
to uphold and defend the
Constitution. So now it's come

638
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,610
down to the bottom bottom bottom
line, if it's about the

639
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:32,940
Constitution, and the way would
work is we have sufficient

640
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,870
evidence to show that China
meddled in this election, that

641
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:40,020
China compromised people who
were involved in the election

642
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:46,050
process, that that triggers the
2018 Executive Order, which then

643
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:52,110
allows the president to conduct
military tribunals and throw

644
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:55,650
people in jail and arrest them
and get to the bottom of this

645
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,100
and

646
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,820
change the outcome of

647
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:08,370
the 2020 election by having
senators contest multiple states

648
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,990
and the votes and, and have all
of this evidence to show for it.

649
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,130
So it's part media strategy.
It's actually a lot of media

650
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:21,480
strategy, blanketing alternative
media with as much as possible.

651
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:28,410
I mean, like crazy. Okay, I clip
this for you. Because this is

652
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:33,570
just too good. I have heard a
version of this story of this

653
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,290
little clip from this is from
monkey works who's a kind of a

654
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:41,280
prepper YouTuber, but has a lot
of tracking military stuff. I

655
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,610
have heard a version of this
story multiple times my

656
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:50,010
stepdaughter who works at a
functional medicine practice,

657
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,540
had people calling her and
saying well my appointment is in

658
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,170
five days but will you
appointments still go on when

659
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:01,530
they shut down the internet and
electricity? I mean, this is how

660
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:08,250
far this has gone. I have gotten
some intel from someone that I

661
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:13,500
definitely trust okay. A former
high speed guy, Navy high speed

662
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,730
guy if that says anything and he
talking with his buddies at our

663
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,560
current active in

664
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:27,060
you know operations. They said
Be ready to go into a lockdown

665
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:30,240
they're expecting about 10 days
and I'm just kind of giving you

666
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,120
that they said it could be a
week to two weeks we're just

667
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,410
kind of go with 10 days

668
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:39,540
because it seems like a good
even keel number okay. But they

669
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,770
said you guys need to just prep
make sure you got hat you know

670
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:48,510
you have supplies available, get
plenty food and water and just

671
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,520
be expecting it that that this
is

672
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:55,200
going to be a military operation
and it's going to be on a global

673
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,970
scale. So just take that with a
pinch of salt. That's Yes. Oh,

674
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,350
Going out there. But I've heard
this story from so many

675
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:08,820
different sources continuously.
Now back to reality. On January

676
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:12,090
6, something actually can be
done. That will be the final, I

677
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:16,440
think, piece that'll happen in
the government. And then I'll

678
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,740
get back to where we are at this
moment. So this is joy read with

679
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,970
Maxine Waters, you serve with mo
Brooks, you serve with some of

680
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:28,440
these Republican members of the
House, what do you make of the

681
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,770
idea that they're still not
done, that they're now planning

682
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,060
on holding what would basically
be a show vote and force a show

683
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,990
vote in the United States Senate
on January 6, it's shocking, it

684
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:43,650
is absolutely shocking, that
they would continue in their

685
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:47,490
efforts to do what I consider
the highest form of voter

686
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:50,250
suppression. We've never seen
anything like this. The

687
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,120
President of the United States
has gone to 446 courts that have

688
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,110
turned him down, that have said
you have no evidence. And so he

689
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:00,990
went to the Supreme Court, where
he has three members said he's

690
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:03,930
happy to get on the Supreme
Court, they turned you down.

691
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,800
They didn't even let him file.
They didn't let Texas attorney

692
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,640
general who is the head of this
amicus brief that he had, did

693
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,720
not let them file in the Supreme
Court. And they're still moving

694
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:22,260
forward with trying to somehow
invalidate the votes of millions

695
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:26,640
of people in four states. It is
just unbelievable that they

696
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:32,220
would continue this. Either.
They are so I'm so intimidated.

697
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,220
So bullied by the President of
the United States. They can't

698
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:39,690
stand up for democracy and the
constitution that is

699
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,540
hard to understand.

700
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,350
So again, the thinking is, Oh,
no, no, we're all going to get a

701
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:49,410
big civics lesson we're going to
understand and learn about how

702
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:54,030
the constitution really works.
The another great part of this

703
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:59,460
is the resignation of Bill Barr,
which is a resignation was he

704
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,450
kicked out, we don't know. More
interesting is his replacement

705
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:05,010
acting Attorney General.

706
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,730
The acting Attorney General is
from the 82nd airborne and was

707
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:16,650
alongside Mike Flynn in the same
unit. And he's all about toe

708
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:20,280
coercion. And we have to listen,
this is actually from earlier I

709
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,120
think this is from August of
this year. And finally to share

710
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:27,060
a little bit of advice we can
borrow from our historical

711
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,600
predecessors. To begin, I think
it helps to clarify a few

712
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,980
definitions to describe what we
mean by malign foreign

713
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,670
influence, as opposed to what we
might consider just legitimate

714
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:42,720
diplomacy, or candid expressions
of legitimate national interests

715
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,530
that all nations share with one
another in appropriate ways. One

716
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:51,150
definition, that's easiest to
remember, is what we refer to as

717
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:56,820
the three C's framework,
coercive, covert, or corrupt

718
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,600
activities by foreign
governments to influence us

719
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,070
policies, US political
sentiment, US public discourse,

720
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,540
or to interfere in our political
processes themselves. Under the

721
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,050
three C's framework, we
recognize that foreign

722
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:16,110
governments often have
preferences about us policies,

723
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:19,350
or even the outcomes of our
elections. Sometimes those

724
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:22,950
preferences are expressed
openly. Our government sometimes

725
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:26,490
has open preferences about other
countries to when the

726
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,550
preferences are open and
attributable. No one is

727
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:34,320
deceived, or misled. But what
we're concerned about is when

728
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,280
foreign preferences manifest
themselves through malign

729
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:42,390
foreign influence activities
that are again, coercive,

730
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:46,560
covert, or corrupt, whether
their aim is specifically to

731
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,830
influence our elections, or to
influence policymaking and

732
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:52,920
public discourse more broadly.
So everything is set up for the

733
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,580
big report, the big report that
is required, as per the exact

734
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:01,470
2018 Executive Order, where we
will find out exactly what went

735
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:05,940
on with this election. And if
there was one of those three C's

736
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:10,830
that took place, or all three of
them, then we can the president,

737
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:15,810
apparently, and I said it has
very strong powers, to do all

738
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:19,050
kinds of stuff, and we were
getting ready for it. We had the

739
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:21,660
Director of National
Intelligence talking to CBS to

740
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,570
the Pixie girls setting this up,
we were getting ready, he wrote

741
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:27,450
a piece for the Wall Street
Journal and you say China is

742
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:31,200
targeting members of Congress,
with six times the frequency of

743
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,040
Russia and 12 times the
frequency of Iran, what is

744
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,340
behind Beijing's aggressive
approach, so they want laws and

745
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,220
policies out of the United
States that are favorable to

746
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,670
China. And what they're really
trying to do is through

747
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,820
blackmail, through bribery
through overt and covert

748
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:50,760
influence, trying to make sure
that only laws that are

749
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,120
favorable to China are passed.
Have you been to Capitol Hill

750
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:57,660
and have you brief to spread
information to lawmakers, I was

751
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,000
so troubled by what I saw from
the public

752
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,910
as the Director of National
Intelligence, but I went and

753
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:05,820
briefed both the House and
Senate Intelligence Committees

754
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:09,300
on this information, which they
found surprising and troubling.

755
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,600
But that's part of alerting
members of Congress to the

756
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,180
threats that they're facing, and
that the American people are

757
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,570
facing in this broad campaign
that China has to replace the

758
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:21,540
United States as the world's
superpower. When did you read

759
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:24,900
those two intelligence
committees earlier this summer?

760
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,200
So we're all ready for it? We're
set because we're finally going

761
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:34,020
to be told that this is all
about China. And then all my we

762
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:37,800
have a huge security breach
breaching the Treasury

763
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:42,330
Department breaching parts of
the Pentagon, its solar winds,

764
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:45,600
they're everywhere. The Russians
are coming. We're following

765
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,030
breaking developments from the
White House. The National

766
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:51,690
Security Council confirms to NBC
News that they are investigating

767
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:54,990
a hack affecting the Treasury
Department and the unit of the

768
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:58,050
Commerce Department. And
tonight, we've learned Russia is

769
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:01,320
behind it. For more I want to
bring in NBC national security

770
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,160
correspondent Ken Delaney. And
can we have any idea what kind

771
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,940
of information was accessed? We
do not at least yet other than

772
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,880
the fact that a source familiar
with the matter told me the

773
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,850
right now there are no
indications that classified

774
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:18,420
networks have been breached. But
that same source, who confirmed

775
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:21,450
the Washington Post reporting
that the US government believes

776
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:24,660
that this was the work of the
Russian version of the CIA, the

777
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,320
SVR, that same source said that
it's believed that this is a

778
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,470
wider campaign, there may be
more government agencies

779
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:35,250
affected and a number of private
sector agencies. Last week, we

780
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:38,070
reported that the Russians had
hacked a major cybersecurity

781
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:41,310
firm called fireeye. And the way
they are reported to have

782
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:45,330
attacked Treasury and commerce
is through a network management

783
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,580
software that gives them
administrative access. So it's a

784
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:51,660
really devious method, and it
has given them access to, you

785
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:55,380
know, sort of unknown levels of
US government information. The

786
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,900
US government was so concerned
about it. Reuters reported that

787
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,720
there was a National Security
Council meeting about it on

788
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,770
Saturday, Alicia,

789
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,310
I don't know about you, but I
don't think this was China or

790
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:07,710
Russia. I think this was purely
the CIA.

791
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:14,820
And I base that on speaking to
multiple dudes named Ben, who

792
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:17,940
analyzed all of this and and
they said, first of all, if it

793
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,570
was Russia, we would know it.
The Russians are in and out, and

794
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:24,720
they don't leave any tracks. And
although

795
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,680
of course, according to the
reports, solar wind, this

796
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,990
monitoring system was used in 29
of 30 counties that had Dominion

797
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:35,670
voting machines.

798
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:41,040
No, I haven't heard anyone find
any vulnerable penetration or

799
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,530
because of these
vulnerabilities, even though

800
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:46,020
they all had to take down you
know, shut down the systems and

801
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:51,030
patch the software. This to me
sounds like CIA trying to

802
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:55,920
trying to get the Russia story
out there anything anything but

803
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,380
China? I mean, I don't know from
the Snowden era that the CIA has

804
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,140
tools to make everything look
like it was the Russians. Yes.

805
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:08,280
And the firewall is a good ploy.
Make the Russians blame the

806
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,860
Russians and the Russians have
nothing to do they must be very,

807
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:13,380
I don't know if you're laughing
up their sleeve in Russia what

808
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,600
they're thinking but they must
be annoyed by this at some

809
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,860
point. Especially cozy bear have
it there p owed. Well, man, we

810
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,650
don't leave tracks. What are you
talking about? But what is this

811
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:26,970
done? This has delayed the
report in we've received an

812
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:30,180
official notification from the
Office of the Director of

813
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:34,890
National Intelligence. This
afternoon, the DNI was notified

814
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:39,720
by career intelligence officials
that the intelligence community

815
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,860
will not meet the December 18
deadline, as set by the

816
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:47,220
executive order back to Pixie
girl What did Ratcliffe say

817
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:51,270
about election fraud and
interference? Well, DNI

818
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:55,980
Radcliffe leads the 17
intelligence agencies and he has

819
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,760
access to the most highly
classified information that is

820
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,570
held by the US government. And
he told CBS News that there was

821
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:07,890
foreign election interference by
China, or Iran and Russia in

822
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:12,360
November of this year. And he is
anticipating a public report on

823
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,280
those findings in January

824
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:16,770
in January.

825
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:23,880
This ain't gonna make it folks.
And now I'm thinking that

826
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,300
there's somehow there. There's
something going on when you say,

827
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:30,930
the intelligence agencies Well,
they seem to be pretty much all

828
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:34,590
anti Trump. So I don't know
exactly what we're waiting from

829
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:38,010
from them. Or maybe they they
did this hack to somehow now

830
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:42,600
they have to gather the evidence
to show that it was Russia. I

831
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:47,100
don't know but it seems like
this report is not going to make

832
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,400
it that's a very in my mind a
very bad sign. I could be

833
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,620
completely wrong. No.

834
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:57,000
Here is not going to make it
because they don't have a

835
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
report. They're cobbling
something together as

836
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,790
A quick aside spaceforce now,

837
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:08,010
PR executive or only hope has
has become an intelligence

838
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:10,770
agency, there was an executive
board or announcement about it.

839
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:15,750
spaceforce is now the space
force intelligence agency. And

840
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,630
they'll be working on nuclear
space propulsion so we can get

841
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:24,960
to Mars. I love these guys. So
the final rundown here, for

842
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,250
this is the only person I find
credible at all when it comes to

843
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:33,090
the evidence, but man, there is
so much they would there's clip

844
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:38,580
after clip of the Dominion CEO
saying that no, no, no, none of

845
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,910
this was connected to the
internet. And well, I don't

846
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,600
think you could stick in a USB
stick. I don't know. But I mean,

847
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:51,750
feigning honesty and probably
lying. But here is Sidney Powell

848
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:57,330
with one minute of her her
evidence that she feels is

849
00:55:57,330 --> 00:56:02,220
enough to trigger the 2018
Executive Order. I don't know

850
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,650
exactly what she means by that.
I think the report triggers it.

851
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,980
But here we go. So they had
these warehouses of counterfeit

852
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,790
ballots in different parts of
the country, apparently, and

853
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:15,600
then shipped them in the area
light as needed to backfill in

854
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,050
the states where President
Trump's voters poured out in

855
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:22,950
such great number, that they
broke the algorithm they had pre

856
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:26,880
programmed in the computers for
dominion, to create the fraud.

857
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,720
That's why they had to stop
counting in five states. And

858
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,340
that's why it's absolutely
absurd to say that there wasn't

859
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:39,180
voter fraud here. We have
counterfeit ballots, we have

860
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:44,130
dead people voting. And by the
1000s, if not hundreds of 1000s

861
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,720
there were something someone
called Phantom voters, there

862
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,850
were just more manner and means
of fraud than any law abiding

863
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:59,280
American citizen could possibly
imagine. It's stunning. It's

864
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,360
absolutely stunning. And they
were so in our face with it. And

865
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,450
then to deny it is purely
Machiavellian.

866
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:11,550
And ironically, in 2007,

867
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:20,070
then vice president elect or to
be hopeful, Joe Biden was

868
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:23,670
worried about the voting
machines to keep it from us

869
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:26,340
being able to be in a position
where you can manipulate the

870
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:30,150
machines manipulate directors,
the one way to do that is I

871
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:34,110
think we should pass a federal
law, mandating that the same

872
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:37,740
machines with paper trails be
mandatory for every federal

873
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:41,310
election. In a nutshell, I think
we should be mandated, mandating

874
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:45,510
that we have a paper ballot with
a standardized machine

875
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:47,400
standardized requirement.

876
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:52,380
So I don't know about everything
else. But I completely believe

877
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:55,380
after having looked at all the,
quote, unquote, forensics, and

878
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,130
there's a huge report that came
out from the thing, it's the

879
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:02,400
Michigan machines, those
machines are definitely rig

880
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:06,360
rigged, and that that has to
stop no matter what. I think

881
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:07,950
everyone kind of agrees on that.

882
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,770
Well, here's what I've got.

883
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:16,920
This election was last in May of
2019.

884
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:21,930
When when

885
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,780
Trump put together his that
executive order in November

886
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:32,190
16 2018, he put together an
operation, which is now has a $3

887
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:35,940
billion budget, and they have a
big website, and it's kind of

888
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,340
kind of interested in is called
the cyber security and

889
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:40,350
infrastructure security agency.

890
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:47,190
And this was set up specifically
to prevent the any fraudulent

891
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,180
activity in the upcoming
election. And it was moving

892
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,630
along just fine. And it was
being run by this guy chris

893
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:58,770
chris, who is fired immediately
after the election because he

894
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:01,530
says they couldn't find anything
wrong with the election and he's

895
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:06,990
the one that headed up headed up
the let me put up this. Clearly

896
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:10,170
it's Sisa on the line for you.
They want you to shut down. They

897
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:12,600
want you to shut down your solar
winds, please.

898
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:17,850
While you're doing that, I will
play a creepy robo call. Here we

899
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:24,150
go. Creepy robo call of the day.
It's just a test call. Time to

900
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:27,780
stay home. Stay safe and stay
home.

901
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:35,730
Wow. Anyway, I got a couple of
new robots recently. Anyway, so

902
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:39,180
he set up this agency this began
he set up this agency and you

903
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:45,690
can go see it. It's a SCI fi.gov
It's a massive website and now

904
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:49,290
they even they're even producing
graphic novels have a link to

905
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:52,170
the graphic novel for
downloading the next newsletter.

906
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:53,190
I've seen that.

907
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,750
So, so this guy Krabs was
running the thing and everything

908
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,000
was going along swimmingly. But
what he

909
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,420
happened was. And if you look
into the background, this

910
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:05,910
agency, there was a student
government report that

911
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:09,900
discovered this, I'm going to
read it. In October of 2020

912
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,360
review for the Institute for
world politics, a student

913
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:16,470
journal active measures, stated
that C is a and by the way, this

914
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:19,920
is one of my pet peeves about
all these agencies, apparently

915
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,080
lacks an enforcement division,

916
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:26,220
which did have the federal
protection services, which

917
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:30,060
resorted until 2010, under the
US Immigration and Customs

918
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:33,480
Enforcement was actually working
for these guys. It was moved in

919
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:39,240
May 2019. From the CIA, NSA to
the DHS management directory

920
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:43,770
Directorate. So it was their
enforcement capabilities, which

921
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:47,130
means you can't find crimes if
you don't have inspectors and

922
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:47,490
and

923
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,280
virtual cops out there people
doing investigations if there's

924
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,700
no investigators, right? You're
not gonna find anything. And

925
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,020
they took the investigation of

926
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:03,810
capabilities away from this
agency to $3 billion agency in

927
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:06,720
May of 2019. And that's when the
election was lost. Well, how did

928
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,350
this happen? Well, if you look
into it, hmm. This is after

929
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:17,730
after Christian Nielsen quit.
Right. In April of 2019. They

930
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:21,690
moved in this in some guy who
last it was there for six months

931
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:27,360
only came and left on his own.
Nobody pushed him out. He came

932
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:32,400
in and in April and in May
implemented this removal of the

933
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,410
enforcement capability. Who is
this guy? Kevin McLean, and and

934
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:41,010
who is Kevin McLean. He was a
he's that old hack from Border

935
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:43,770
Patrol, but he was, let me just
read this from this from the

936
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:47,910
Wikipedia. President Trump
nominated McLean and McLennan

937
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:51,570
McLennan to assume the position
of Commissioner in a permanent

938
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:52,380
capacity.

939
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:56,280
McKenna's previous nomination
was supported by officials from

940
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:01,410
both the George Bush and Barack
Obama administration's old

941
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:03,390
rhinos in the Democrat Party.

942
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:07,860
A number of whom signed a letter
to Congress expressing

943
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:11,730
enthusiastic support for the
supreme Li qualified McLennan.

944
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:18,120
He says then and read on a he
says when he quit few months

945
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:22,140
later after he had done the
dirty deed of sabotaging this

946
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:25,740
agency by removing its
enforcement capabilities,

947
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,800
leaving them toothless so the
whole thing was a joke and this

948
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,410
was bound to happen and there's
no way they're gonna prove

949
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:34,110
anything did happen because they
had nobody investigating it. So

950
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:36,930
this reports coming up get
everything's coming up dead.

951
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:41,220
Everybody had anything to say
about this is full of shit. And

952
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,370
he and Bronwyn McLean and quits.
He says he felt he had

953
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:45,630
accomplished all he could

954
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:51,090
just walk to have more time with
his family. Oh, yeah. And that's

955
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:55,470
the beginning of the end right
there in in in 2019. So this

956
01:02:55,470 --> 01:03:00,660
thing was pre done. It was a
done deal. The Bush faction of

957
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:03,690
the Republican Party, which is a
huge part of the party, Jeb Bush

958
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:07,920
got his revenge. And the whole
Democratic Party teamed up it

959
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,410
wasn't anybody else. It wasn't
the Russian the Chinese or

960
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:13,650
anything else. It was an inside
job. That's why nobody's gonna

961
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:17,460
stand up in Congress, because
the deals over and Trump is

962
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,530
done. And now we're going to
move on from there. And that's

963
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:19,830
it.

964
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:26,580
My friend Jean, surging to you.
He said something over

965
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:30,540
Thanksgiving, which I think is
very astute. We all know Trump

966
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:34,650
for his you're fired that that's
his brand. You're fired. What

967
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:40,200
the real issue is that Trump has
a hiring problem. he hires

968
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:44,520
really shitty people. Now he's
smart that he's able to fire

969
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,340
people and just get rid of him
right away or whenever it's a

970
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:51,540
problem, but even then, maybe
not. I don't even think Kevin

971
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:55,230
Ah, or Amy Kony Barrett might
have been good good choices for

972
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:57,540
him for what he's trying to
achieve.

973
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:04,140
Bar Well, we know bar was
although bar did a lot of strong

974
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:07,290
things. We always knew that he
still he and Moeller their

975
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:10,620
buddies, they they have 911
business that they don't want

976
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:15,810
anyone to know about and and him
resigning right at this moment.

977
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:21,120
He has a he has a real hiring
problem he has hired and maybe

978
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:24,690
the pool is just so it's just
nobody that can do anything that

979
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:26,910
isn't compromised these days.
That's possible.

980
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:34,050
But we shall see the executive
order. And the President came

981
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:36,390
out with a couple more executive
orders which weren't really

982
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:39,060
discussed the order of
succession with the Department

983
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:44,610
of Defense. So that keeps Trump
loyals or who he thinks as high

984
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:48,450
as hired as a loyal close to the
chest if there's some succession

985
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:55,410
issue. Now, there's also
triggers in there for the if you

986
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:58,950
recall the we talked about this
the continuation of the National

987
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:00,000
Emergency respectively.

988
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,150
serious human rights abuses and
corruption, which was his a

989
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:06,000
human trafficking, executive
order.

990
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:11,639
There's there's just a number of
different things. I mean, I hear

991
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:12,389
what you're saying.

992
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:19,290
I do see a lot of people very
looking very frightened about

993
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:22,380
what may or may not happen in
the next couple of weeks. Number

994
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:27,510
one would be just Layne Maxwell.
She is desperately trying to get

995
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:31,140
a, you know, she's trying to
cobble together $30 million in

996
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,930
bail. She knows what's coming.
If she stays in jail.

997
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:40,530
She knows she's doing anything
to get out. She's got friends

998
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,590
pitching in money to show that
you know, all these people

999
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:44,430
support me.

1000
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,510
Then again, we'll we'll see. I
mean, now this report is not due

1001
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:57,030
until January. I don't feel so
good about this. But, you know,

1002
01:05:57,090 --> 01:06:00,150
the people would counter me
immediately and say, trust the

1003
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:05,460
plan. So we'll see what happens.
We'll see what happens. I am

1004
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:11,730
still very open. And in my heart
of hearts, I am hurt by the fact

1005
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:15,090
that we can have an honest
election not surprised. Because

1006
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:17,730
Gee, we kind of figured there
must be some kind of gambling

1007
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:22,140
going on there. But this level,
certainly of the digital, that's

1008
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,780
something we can stop. We can
stop right away. Just stop that

1009
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,960
bullcrap voting machines, you
can't trust it.

1010
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:32,430
I don't think there's anything
to do with it. I think that's a

1011
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:36,690
red herring. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, there's real. Let me

1012
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:41,250
finish. The whole thing was the
mail in ballots. You send

1013
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:44,460
ballots every time Dick and
Harry in the world, just send

1014
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:47,010
them out by the millions.
They're all gonna vote Democrat.

1015
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:50,640
Correct. I'm not disagreeing
with you. And if you heard

1016
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,400
Sidney Powell, I know it's hard
for you to listen to her. She

1017
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,580
said because the algorithm
didn't work with the amount of

1018
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:59,880
votes that came in for Trump.
That's when they had to bring in

1019
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:03,120
all these phony baloney ballots.
I believe that happened. That

1020
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:03,900
makes sense.

1021
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:10,440
Now doesn't make sense to me. It
doesn't know at this point,

1022
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:15,150
because I regret revert back to
an old you're telling me 155

1023
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:18,240
million people voted in this
election and often, and the

1024
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:23,640
majority of them are valid legal
votes. Oh, of course not. But if

1025
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:27,150
you get it, we had three or four
bows show up in our house that

1026
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:31,440
weren't anyone here, right? We
didn't send them in, though. But

1027
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,190
the point is, is that they were
harvested, they were harvested,

1028
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:38,910
they were collected, they were
shipped all over. Do a mail in

1029
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:41,850
Bell, this is what you're gonna
have to expect both sides can

1030
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:48,780
cheat, right? Oh, and I'm sure
both sides cheated. But I find

1031
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:53,190
that the voting machine evidence
undeniable, it's undeniable. I

1032
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:55,980
think it's very deniable and I
deny it. Well, then you haven't

1033
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:58,920
read the reports. There's
reports that these reports are

1034
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,470
very sketchy to know this. Did
you see that?

1035
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:06,090
Major ruse, and yeah, I'm sure
it happened here and there. But

1036
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:12,300
unless they have this $3 billion
agency, sitting there that was

1037
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:16,740
put together by Trump, and they
said, No, nothing happened and

1038
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:19,770
the guy got fired the next day.
Yeah, if this agency is not

1039
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:22,410
going to come up with anything,
then all this other stuff is

1040
01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:24,450
just a lot. It's just a lot of
noise.

1041
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,760
The agency was put together to
stop this from happening. Yeah.

1042
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:35,340
But john Oh, hold on a second,
as healthcare.gov was set up and

1043
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:38,610
billions of dollars expense to
get health insurance going.

1044
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:42,060
Since when are you surprised
that a government agency sucked?

1045
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:48,510
As soon as they lost your
enforcement capability in 2019.

1046
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:53,400
Thanks to Bush, the bush is and
the ball Obama is working

1047
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,220
together. They didn't have
there's no way they could ever

1048
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:59,190
investigating this stuff
properly. But but more that's

1049
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:02,280
fine. I'm good with you there.
But you're saying it didn't

1050
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:04,260
happen. That's what you just
heard you say.

1051
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:08,010
voting machines is bullcrap.
That's what you just said.

1052
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:10,680
There's no evidence. I mean,
they shouldn't have been put in

1053
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,530
in the first place. The point is
that when the the state

1054
01:09:13,530 --> 01:09:16,290
governments, the way it's set
up, the state governments are

1055
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:19,200
the ones who get to call who
gets to be the electorate, the

1056
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,610
and they also broke, they also
broke the rules and the law and

1057
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:27,540
the Constitution doesn't matter.
They their rules or whatever

1058
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:30,030
they want to be if they're
breaking the rules as part of

1059
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:34,140
their system, and they say, only
if done by the legislature, not

1060
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:39,090
by the judges, but that debt. It
still got signed off by somebody

1061
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:43,500
or somebody else. Of course,
we're not I'm not arguing but

1062
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:46,380
you said, Look, I just say I'm
in Nevada, why are you arguing?

1063
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:51,660
corrupt? Why are you arguing?
Because it's arguable. The point

1064
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:55,230
is, is I'm in Nevada and I said
cuz everything's being ignored.

1065
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:59,730
The mechanism is being ignored.
Yeah, it's corrupt. I'm a data

1066
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:00,000
analyst.

1067
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,190
Say, I've got a legislature
that's completely corrupt. Mindy

1068
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:08,610
Robbins is always bitching about
this. And you have everybody

1069
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:11,430
okay, we're gonna have a
election. Everybody vote Okay,

1070
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:14,220
we all voted for Trump 100%.
Well, we're gonna send our

1071
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:18,240
electors are dividing, we don't
care. That's their business.

1072
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:18,810
Yes.

1073
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:21,720
And so Biden gets the votes.

1074
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,820
So whatever the mechanism
underneath the sign off the sign

1075
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:29,880
off of the, of the electoral
college people, whatever that

1076
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,730
mechanism is, no matter how
screwed up it is, they got to

1077
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,840
take voting machines doesn't
nothing works, right? The belts

1078
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,230
are all switched, is where they
sign off on. That's their

1079
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:43,920
business. And so they sign off
on and Biden gets in. Right, in

1080
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,440
the olden days are never used to
be a popular vote, they just

1081
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:49,140
have a meeting and decide on
who's going to be president.

1082
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,040
Right. But then

1083
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:56,760
by that logic, then on January 5
of January 6, Vice President

1084
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,220
Pence can also do stuff within
his purview.

1085
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:06,000
Well, you should, then there's
this distinct possibility,

1086
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,460
though, there's a lot of
alternatives that can happen.

1087
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:10,710
I'm just saying there's not a
chance in hell, any of them are

1088
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:14,490
even gonna show up. Okay. Good.
I think there may be one guy in

1089
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,270
all of Congress, one, one of
these characters is going to

1090
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,940
protest. And that's going to end
is just to be voted down. If

1091
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:22,920
this is a done deal is over.

1092
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:26,970
Well, I'm You may be right.

1093
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:30,960
I don't think it's a done deal.
I think we still had there's

1094
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,900
going to be a couple more tries
before it's a done deal or

1095
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:35,280
before something happens.

1096
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:37,350
But

1097
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,580
I don't know. I I have to say
that there's so much in here

1098
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:50,460
that even if whatever reelection
coup tries to do is attempted

1099
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:55,200
here. We have serious problems.
We got we have a serious problem

1100
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,770
with the administration that's
coming in, we have a serious

1101
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:04,860
problem with our our voting
system is just I mean, it needs

1102
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:08,460
real review and needs to be
looked at. Because it's the

1103
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:12,180
combination of things that makes
it a problem and yes, mailing

1104
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:12,660
voting.

1105
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:17,970
And hopefully, we'll find out
exactly what went on if what I'm

1106
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:21,150
led to believe we have records
of everything and everything was

1107
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:23,850
being done. And that should come
out in this big report. This is

1108
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:27,780
why I'm a little concerned that
reports not coming out or won't

1109
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:33,090
come out in time. But meanwhile,
we do have some real crap going

1110
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:33,420
down.

1111
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:41,730
which you probably also won't
hear a lot about. Certainly not

1112
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:46,410
if if you're right. The Biden
administration comes into into

1113
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:49,320
office, we won't be hearing much
about China,

1114
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:53,520
even though they're trying to do
stuff in the Senate and in the

1115
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,030
house and Capitol Hill trying to
say Hey, you guys, we've got

1116
01:12:57,030 --> 01:13:00,300
China all over the place. We've
got China all over the Biden

1117
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:03,720
clan 50 people associate with
the intelligence community

1118
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:08,070
during the our after our hunter
Biden investigation. And the

1119
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:11,220
revelations of the hunter Biden
computer said, Oh, this is, you

1120
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,770
know, this is Russian
disinformation. Now we find out

1121
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:17,400
that's real investigation by the
Justice Department. So it's just

1122
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:21,240
galling, and I just have to
point out that the purveyors of

1123
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:25,050
Russian disinformation, Hillary
Clinton's campaign, the DNC, the

1124
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:29,460
steel dossier, the ranking
member, Peters, accusing Senator

1125
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:33,930
Grassley and I of disseminating
Russian disinformation. That's

1126
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:36,660
where the disinformation is
coming. That's where the false

1127
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:40,050
information the lies, just stop
for just a second.

1128
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:41,850
This?

1129
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,200
Who is this guy, Ron Johnson, of
course, oh, it's Ron Johnson. I

1130
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,110
didn't realize it before. If you
backed it up and started over.

1131
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:53,730
He sounds just like like the
nutty Tom Arnold. Oh, that's a

1132
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:57,900
good point. Hey, by the way,
where our Tom Arnold's PP tapes.

1133
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:03,090
disappointing is that guy 50
people associate with the

1134
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:06,690
intelligence community during
the after our hunter Biden

1135
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:09,750
investigation. And the
revelations of the hunter Biden

1136
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:12,480
computer said, Oh, this is, you
know, this is Russian

1137
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,690
disinformation. Now we find out
that's real investigation by the

1138
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:19,260
Justice Department. So it's just
galling, and I just have to

1139
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:23,670
point out that the purveyors of
Russian disinformation, Hillary

1140
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:27,300
Clinton's campaign, the DNC, the
steel dossier, the ranking

1141
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:30,750
member, Peters, accusing Senator
Grassley and I have

1142
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:34,590
disseminating Russian
disinformation. That's where the

1143
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:38,070
dissertation is coming. That's
where the false information, the

1144
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:42,450
lies the false allegations. I
can't sit by here and listen to

1145
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:46,170
this. And say that this is this
is not disinformation, this

1146
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:48,780
hearing today, this is getting
information we have to take a

1147
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:54,360
look at to restore confidence.
In our election integrity, we're

1148
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:57,180
not going to be able to just
move on without bringing up

1149
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:59,580
these irregularities examining
them

1150
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,600
providing an explanation and see
where there really are problems

1151
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,990
so we can correct it moving
forward. Senator Paul. Mr. Mr.

1152
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:08,940
Chairman, I gotta respond to
that. I mean, you're saying I'm

1153
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:11,940
putting out right. Well, one I
didn't have nothing to do with

1154
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,090
this report. You You lied
repeatedly and not you lied

1155
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:17,790
repeatedly in the press, and I
was spreading messages Russian

1156
01:15:17,790 --> 01:15:20,430
disinformation. And that was an
outright lie. And I told you to

1157
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:23,910
stop lying, and you continue to
do it. Mr. Chairman, this is not

1158
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:26,220
about airing your grievances. I
know what I don't know what

1159
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:26,940
rabbit hole you're

1160
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:31,800
exactly what Senator Paul says
simply not what we're dealing

1161
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:36,030
with. So Mr. Chairman, you can't
make a good start. And then drop

1162
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:39,780
it there. Yeah, we can listen to
Tom Arnold about the PP tapes

1163
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:42,750
back from back in the day. When
was this this was I love our

1164
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:48,210
archives. We have is this from
2018 what is the power what is

1165
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:51,000
on the tapes that you're gonna
release on on

1166
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,610
Donald Trump? You know, he's

1167
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:58,410
this this president, he's gonna
tape this substance available to

1168
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:03,450
the public already should be
disqualified for, for a guy to

1169
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:07,470
to rent a car for instance, he
started day one by calling it

1170
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:11,430
faking his own voice to say his
father had given him his money

1171
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:14,970
and he was really a billionaire.
And he's done. He's admitted to

1172
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:19,440
walk into the Miss Universe
pageant to see them naked and

1173
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,750
brag about that on howard stern.
So the stuff that's for public

1174
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:26,700
consumption already is it's just
horrible that that and you know,

1175
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:30,390
the tape that I heard he's uses
the Edward he calls his son,

1176
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:35,910
Eric, the R word for people with
you know, it just just

1177
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:37,920
discussing sex.

1178
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:45,030
Yeah, that was about different
tapes. That was about the race

1179
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:49,800
racist tapes forgot about Yeah,
that never got out either. So

1180
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:55,410
now we do have one final report.
Regarding China and the Biden

1181
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:59,160
crime syndicate from lou dobbs.
Today, Fox News obtained a

1182
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:04,770
letter that further exposes the
entire Biden family's ties to a

1183
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:08,760
Chinese energy company. For
details now we turn to Fox News

1184
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,690
correspondent Mike Emanuel, in
Washington, Mike blue. Good

1185
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:15,720
evening, Fox has obtained June
2017 correspondence between

1186
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:20,340
hunter Biden and the chairman of
CFC China energy company, with

1187
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:24,270
hunter offering Best wishes from
the entire Biden family and

1188
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:29,130
urging Yeon Ming to quickly send
a $10 million wire to properly

1189
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:32,580
fund and operate Hunter's joint
venture with the now bankrupt

1190
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:36,180
firm by netted. We are all
hoping to see you here again

1191
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:40,290
soon or in Shanghai, Fox has
told the $10 million transfer to

1192
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:43,380
the joint venture was never
completed. Some allies of

1193
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:46,020
President Trump are saying it
may be time for a special

1194
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:48,810
counsel to look into hunter
Biden's business dealings

1195
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:52,650
concerned by the administration
may not be interested in a

1196
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:56,160
serious criminal investigation.
Also today, a prominent

1197
01:17:56,160 --> 01:18:00,150
republican called that big tech
for suppressing the hunter Biden

1198
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:05,220
story, these giant corporate
conglomerates, censoring and

1199
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:09,060
suppressing news directly
bearing on an election weeks

1200
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:12,810
beforehand. The most powerful
corporations in the world.

1201
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:18,270
Facebook, Twitter, working with
the democrat campaign to

1202
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:22,380
suppress legitimize Stop, stop,
stop. I don't know if it's just

1203
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:27,780
me. But this guy sounds like Al
Gore. He does a little bit. It's

1204
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:33,060
the it's a young guy. I forget
his name. Haha, Holly. Holly, I

1205
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:36,900
think is Holly. He's the guy
that's been anti Silicon Valley

1206
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:41,820
forever. And I like him. I think
he's from Tennessee. I want to

1207
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:44,730
say I think he's from Tennessee
almost done seeing news,

1208
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:48,510
directly bearing on an election
weeks beforehand. The most

1209
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:52,860
powerful corporations in the
world, Facebook, Twitter,

1210
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:57,600
working with the democrat
campaign to suppress legitimate

1211
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,620
reporting on hunter Biden, who
we now know is under a federal

1212
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:06,780
investigation for criminal wire
fraud tax evasion. Other things?

1213
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:09,810
No poor Hunter, he's going to
have to go away.

1214
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,700
Thank Yes, I think it would be
funny. And I think this might

1215
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:19,950
happen before the 20th that a
special prosecutors put in place

1216
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:25,620
to investigate this by Trump or
his or his new Attorney General.

1217
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,960
And they just leave him there
when they leave they they're

1218
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:31,230
stuck with this guy you can't
get and they got either fire him

1219
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,280
which will be a brouhaha over
that. Yeah. Are they gonna have

1220
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:39,660
to do his thing? It's like it
this is ludicrous except for

1221
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:44,040
Obama. Every one of these
presidents has been under fire

1222
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:47,730
and and everyone went soft on
Obama. They let him do what he

1223
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:50,190
wanted. And I did go I'm pretty
soft on Joe.

1224
01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:56,760
It has started yet. They won't
be soft on Joe at all right?

1225
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:59,970
Yeah. If anything, I think this
is more

1226
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,930
Move and you're seeing is how
fox is all over to move from the

1227
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:06,900
democrats to get rid of Joe
don't want him out. Yes, they

1228
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:11,100
can bring in the true puppet,
which is a comma. So the final

1229
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:15,120
thing on the China update is
there's not a lot while the UK

1230
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:19,890
is spending some time on the CCP
database with the 1.9 million

1231
01:20:19,890 --> 01:20:24,030
names of people who are
affiliated, or if not direct

1232
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:27,660
members of the Chinese Communist
Party who are in companies all

1233
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:32,700
around the globe. And we have in
the US, Boeing, Qualcomm,

1234
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:33,630
Pfizer.

1235
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:39,450
But my favorite was this one,
members of the committee of the

1236
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:43,800
joint branch of the Shanghai
second Disney machine of the

1237
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:48,210
Communist Party of China. I have
no idea what that committee

1238
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:52,620
does. I know. Isn't that great?
Is that really the name? Yes.

1239
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:55,980
It's in this database. Committee
of the

1240
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:01,950
it's the committee again, the
Committee of the joint branch of

1241
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:08,160
the Shanghai second Disney
machine of the community. Yes. I

1242
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,910
know the machine it says Disney
machine. Now maybe this is a bad

1243
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:16,230
translation. That could be but
I've received this from several

1244
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:18,960
people. And it's in the database
with the database, we put in the

1245
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,060
show notes. And there's a
translated version out there

1246
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:23,460
too. So I don't know.

1247
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:28,050
But they control a lot. So they
will continue and they've got

1248
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:31,290
Tom Cruise on the front lines
and everybody working it out.

1249
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:36,180
And China Joe, Beijing Biden is
almost in office, so I can't

1250
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,730
wait. It's gonna be spectacular.

1251
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,290
It'll be good for a laugh.

1252
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:49,740
Yes, it'll be good. It'd be very
good for a laugh. Well, these

1253
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:52,200
Chinese are they're they're
overstepping. They're, they're

1254
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,210
they're overstepping their
something.

1255
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:58,800
But what's the role phrase or
overstepping their boundaries?

1256
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,430
overstepping the boundary, the
boundary? They're, they're

1257
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:07,080
overdoing it. You're gonna be
sorry. Well, I hope so. I don't

1258
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,430
know how they'll be sorry.

1259
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:13,530
If Joe's in office, you think
anything's gonna happen, nothing

1260
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:14,130
will happen.

1261
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:18,870
You don't know that. And I'm
gonna just going to say up

1262
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:23,520
front. Whereas I still have hope
in 45. Savin say saving the day

1263
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,710
in the Constitution and the
Republic.

1264
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:33,000
I have no illusions over what's
going to happen if he doesn't,

1265
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:36,330
and moving forward, we're just
completely controlled by China.

1266
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,530
Big tech everything.

1267
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:42,660
Well, I'm glad we're controlling
coin all these locals around

1268
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:44,250
here were controlled by Putin.

1269
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,630
That's just California man,
Texas is different. And with

1270

Curry also in the morning, all

1273
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:03,450
boots on the ground in the air
subs in the water games in the

1274
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:07,350
nights out there in the morning
to our trolls in the troll room.

1275
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:11,580
Let's see how you doing on this
fine December day. 1918 is the

1276
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:14,610
number. That's the trolls we got
hanging out. It's nice if we

1277
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:17,760
cracked 2000 But okay, I'll just
have to let you slide for today.

1278
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,400
You do on Thursday. It is hard
to have done. Yes. Hands up

1279
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,250
trolls Hands up. Zoom meetings
instead.

1280
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:28,680
Yeah, I'm sure they are. The
trolls are to be found. If you

1281
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,960
feel like you're affiliated or
would like to learn how to

1282
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,010
become one, go to no agenda
stream.com you can dive in

1283
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,070
there. And there's a troll room
which is a chat room with

1284
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:40,680
trolls. And there's a stream
which you can listen to

1285
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:43,410
simultaneously listen to the
show live we do it on Thursdays

1286
01:23:43,410 --> 01:23:46,650
and Sundays many shows are done
live. In addition to that.

1287
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:54,480
We have a social network which
you can ask for an invite. Don't

1288
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,930
ask me ask the trolls. No
agenda. Social calm is where the

1289
01:23:57,930 --> 01:24:01,380
signal to noise is remarkably
high because it's a federated

1290
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:05,130
social network that does not
utilize any algorithms you come

1291
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:08,280
in, you start at the top. When
you read something you've read,

1292
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:10,920
you've probably seen everything
you need to see there's no other

1293
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:14,280
things flying around trying to
hook in is just there for your

1294
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:17,850
pleasure and your enjoyment and
for usefulness. That is no

1295
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:23,340
agenda social.com and then we
need to thank the artists who

1296
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:27,540
did the artwork for Episode
Episode 1303 we titled that one

1297
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:30,900
the Redneck herring. This was
the bumper car done by tungsten

1298
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:35,190
nail who is no stranger to the
to the artwork. It wasn't my

1299
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:39,840
favorite. You'd liked it right
off the bat you I gave in I

1300
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,250
guess that Oh yeah. I didn't
come up. No, you had one that

1301
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:46,950
you like but you didn't have an
you didn't have any argument

1302
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:50,820
then which one was that? That
was the problem you didn't die

1303
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:51,660
bail.

1304
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,070
Well, you know as as just
witness, sometimes it just makes

1305
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:58,920
sense to stop arguing with you
because you're right numb wrong.

1306
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,970
So that's it.

1307
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,360
I think that would be true most
of that's and that's usually how

1308
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,120
I just ended it. That's the
easiest. Yeah, let's let's do

1309
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,730
it. here's the here's the one
that that's I'm looking at these

1310
01:25:08,730 --> 01:25:12,510
now. I forgot which one you
liked. Yeah. The Tata nail one.

1311
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,110
I you

1312
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:17,790
I liked it for a number of
reasons. One it looked like a

1313
01:25:17,790 --> 01:25:21,630
slipper very comfortable
looking. And it was cute is a

1314
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:24,660
cute little bumper car which we
had some thing and you didn't

1315
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:28,500
really have a strong candidate.
And you finally gave it I don't

1316
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,690
think you'd like you didn't
mention it. You didn't like the

1317
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:34,380
best podcast in the universe,
emblazoned across the top like

1318
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:37,680
that. No, I didn't like this as
the letters the fonts any of

1319
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:40,860
that? No, I didn't really like
yeah, you were birthed about a

1320
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:45,540
lot of this. Now the one I that
we kind of got passed over and I

1321
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,780
had I'd used it for the
newsletter because it was so

1322
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:53,190
it's such a good piece was
Riley's Santa Claus. Walmart

1323
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:57,060
Santa yes we did discuss that
one and by the way you're seeing

1324
01:25:57,060 --> 01:26:00,990
all of this in your podcasting
2.0 app go to new podcast apps

1325
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:01,560
calm

1326
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:08,130
and I I missed one of the gags
unfortunately on this one I may

1327
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:13,650
have actually promoted this more
if I had got the joke, which I

1328
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:17,130
did I felt bad about and then
which one was this newsletter?

1329
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,130
Which one was this? Well I
complain about what kind of a

1330
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:24,390
Stan has got a blue hat on? Ah
yes, I recall the combo Yeah.

1331
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:28,650
And I then I look back Oh, he's
wearing a Walmart costume.

1332
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,710
Because he's a Walmart
employees. You see his name

1333
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:35,820
there's a little name tag on his
shoulder so the Walmart color

1334
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:40,560
was put instead of red for the
hat. And I didn't get the joke.

1335
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:47,730
So I joined that got removed the
I did plug it on the newsletter

1336
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:51,960
so yeah, I feel don't feel
totally bad about it. But there

1337
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,940
wasn't really anything else I
don't think

1338
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,950
No, I like China Joe and his
gang but even we both agreed

1339
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:01,320
that wasn't good enough far but
it was good. I liked it. It was

1340
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:01,830
funny.

1341
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:07,830
That controversial You did say
to me though, at the end,

1342
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:09,810
because you didn't like this
piece.

1343
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,250
That I'm going to have to
explain it.

1344
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:18,930
Yeah, public somehow somehow I
somehow remember there being a

1345
01:27:18,930 --> 01:27:22,680
lot more controversy then than
there is now. Really remember

1346
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:23,010
why

1347
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:28,350
put forth. Controversy was
simple. You didn't like the

1348
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:31,470
peace but you had no alternative
alternative now. That's right.

1349
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:35,760
I didn't like but I liked the
peace. I still I still like the

1350
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,790
peace. I like it. I think it's
cute. I'd like to have a bumper

1351
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:41,940
car that looked like that be
fantastic. Oh, so sweet.

1352
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:48,690
This is only a part of the time
and talented people put into

1353
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:51,690
into these shows. I want to
thank Neil who's been doing a

1354
01:27:51,690 --> 01:27:55,410
kick ass job of sending clips.
But we have so many people

1355
01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:59,760
who've really honed their skills
on making clips. Again, it's not

1356
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,220
very helpful. If you say this is
an hour and a half, you'll

1357
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:06,030
definitely get something out of
it. Yeah, yeah, I definitely

1358
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:09,030
won't. I mean, because I get
five of those. You won't listen

1359
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:13,350
to them five of those a day.
Also. And this is all said with

1360
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:16,050
love. I'm your producer. So I'm
just you know, I'm like Tom

1361
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:18,630
Cruise in you know, for a
second, except you won't get

1362
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:19,170
fired.

1363
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:26,190
If you if you got a hearing, for
example, don't send 15 clips.

1364
01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:32,190
Have you ever heard us play 15
clips of anything? Three max for

1365
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:36,180
if it's crazy out there. You
have to kill your darlings make

1366
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:40,170
your selections. That's how we
make the show even better.

1367
01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:43,800
Because you know, then listening
through 15 clips that are all

1368
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:46,710
two minutes. That's another half
hour I just run out of time in

1369
01:28:46,710 --> 01:28:49,560
the day. I'm sure john you have
the same but but it's really

1370
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:52,050
appreciated what people are
doing and we love when people

1371
01:28:52,050 --> 01:28:55,890
come in with their treasure,
which is the third leg of the

1372
01:28:55,890 --> 01:29:01,590
value for value stool. That's it
we're and we'd like to honor

1373
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:05,340
these donors with their
appropriate titles of executive

1374
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:08,520
producer and associate executive
producer of the no agenda Show

1375
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,860
Episode 1304

1376
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,970
indeed, and we're gonna start
with

1377
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:22,950
sir Mecca. nudo dela paz in new
brown fells Texas. Yay. I wish

1378
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:26,490
the New Braunfels barbecue
company was still in business

1379
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:28,680
$1,000

1380
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:34,080
and the Hondo grill one of the
greatest devices ever made for

1381
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:39,780
cooking. Sat sir makan nudo de
la paz, I hit my wife Elizabeth

1382
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:42,990
in the mouse two or three times.
And then about two months ago.

1383
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:50,040
I found her repotting plants on
the back porch and listening of

1384
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,850
her own volition who knows to
the greatest podcast in years

1385
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:57,000
nowadays. She asked me about
segments of this show and we

1386
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,880
discuss it on a regular basis.
You're saved.

1387
01:30:01,079 --> 01:30:04,919
Yes, yeah, I agree. Your
deconstructions have taken what

1388
01:30:04,949 --> 01:30:08,429
was already a match made in
heaven to a level of marital

1389
01:30:08,909 --> 01:30:14,459
harmony that I never imagined
She is an instant aim Yay.

1390
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:18,450
I wonder is going to give her
the executive producer ship to

1391
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:22,980
Dame sparkler of new Browns
fells please play the jingle

1392
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:26,340
with the park Pink Floyd under
it. At first john thought it was

1393
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:30,390
a dog but it sounds native to
me. Sounds native to me like

1394
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:34,440
Navajo or Pawnee. I'm not. I
have no idea what this

1395
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:39,240
references in any any event
putting Pink Floyd under it is

1396
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:42,990
genius. We love you guys. Yes, I
think that he gets the executive

1397
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:45,960
producer ship she gets the dame
hood. I'm fine with that. So

1398
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:48,570
they can kind of split it up.
They are no agenda together

1399
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:51,720
after all, and what he's
referring to is not something we

1400
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:55,080
do. I'd love to take credit for
all these great jingles. No, no,

1401
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:57,180
we can't do that. It's Yoko in
the Bulldog.

1402
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:15,390
There you go. It's actually a
Friday. It's a French Bull

1403
01:31:15,390 --> 01:31:19,560
Terrier, I think is what it is.
It's labeled Yoko and the

1404
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,930
Bulldog. So that's how I
remember it. Yeah, I thought it

1405
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:25,920
was a Boston Terrier, right?
Yes, sir. 22 up Pacific

something you want to say from
time to time. Look no further.

1444
01:33:56,130 --> 01:34:01,050
from Bennington, Vermont, comes
in with a sequential 234568 in

1445
01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:04,800
the morning john and Adam found
y'all via JRE and could not be

1446
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:10,080
happier. Well, we definitely
need to throw in the Rogen

1447
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:10,740
donation.

1448
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:17,820
Making donation as a former self
proclaimed bleeding heart

1449
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:20,730
liberal until April of this year
I've gotten quite the education

1450
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:22,710
over the last nine months. It's
been a roller coaster of

1451
01:34:22,710 --> 01:34:25,620
emotion. There's been loss of
family and friends who might

1452
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:29,670
change perspective. But for the
first time in 53 years, I stand

1453
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:33,690
solid in my convictions and it
feels damn good. I enjoy

1454
01:34:33,690 --> 01:34:36,720
listening to your show because
it's not only informative, it is

1455
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:39,480
entertaining. And since I
basically lost all desire for

1456
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:42,240
anything Hollywood, it's nice to
still have something enter some

1457
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:47,220
ate some entertainment value in
my life. I want to know where we

1458
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:47,670
go here.

1459
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:53,460
happened I just I want to thank
Adam for replying to my past

1460
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:56,280
email and I'm curious if you
ever got to listen to my podcast

1461
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:59,010
rerouted. Not sure if I did

1462
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,300
I know it's mediocre at best
compared to you both but I enjoy

1463
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,820
learning as I go since this is
my first donation in my quest

1464
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:07,560
for Dane hood, I will need a dd

1465
01:35:10,139 --> 01:35:14,399
dd douche. This donation is a
late birthday present for myself

1466
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:19,139
from 12 five and I'm happy to
contribute to the cause. I would

1467
01:35:19,139 --> 01:35:21,539
also like to request them health
Congress for my upcoming three

1468
01:35:21,539 --> 01:35:26,099
year post colon cancer surgery
songs chemotherapy on the 28th

1469
01:35:26,369 --> 01:35:29,399
but doc says the three year mark
is pivotal and I will only need

1470
01:35:29,399 --> 01:35:33,509
a once a year checkup if all is
going well going forward. Are

1471
01:35:33,509 --> 01:35:36,119
you know I'm fine but little
extra karma doesn't hurt to any

1472
01:35:36,119 --> 01:35:39,569
and all listeners Please take it
for me to get screened. I was

1473
01:35:39,569 --> 01:35:42,329
misdiagnosed for 10 years and
would not have needed life

1474
01:35:42,359 --> 01:35:46,229
altering surgery if I had if I
had gotten a colonoscopy. That

1475
01:35:46,229 --> 01:35:49,649
being said I am not have the F
cancer mindset as I learned how

1476
01:35:49,649 --> 01:35:54,029
strong light I am through all of
it and that is a gift. It is

1477
01:35:54,029 --> 01:35:56,909
also I could not care less about
COVID because something is

1478
01:35:56,909 --> 01:35:59,729
eventually going to kill me but
I'm not living in fear of

1479
01:35:59,729 --> 01:36:02,339

things that we need and keeping
this show rolling, especially in

1648
01:46:57,330 --> 01:47:00,870
these times, where anything you
say is probably Russian

1649
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:03,360
disinformation. So we have to be
careful too. We got to keep

1650
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:06,270
moving ahead. Can't take any

01:47:34,050 --> 01:47:34,590

So we have Kaylee.

1660
01:47:47,310 --> 01:47:50,700
Okay, this is something else you
want to discuss first? Um, well,

1661
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:54,840
I was gonna kind of lead into. I
mean, I got a lot of

1662
01:47:55,890 --> 01:47:59,670
Joe Biden cabinet like stuff and
build back better kind of

1663
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:01,860
things. Okay, let's do that.
First.

1664
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:09,210
I do have a Biden clip. Yes, you
know, it's not a full on that

1665
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:11,850
are true. gaff is kind of minor,
you probably have some better

1666
01:48:11,850 --> 01:48:14,850
material once you just run with
it. Well, what's your Biden clip

1667
01:48:14,850 --> 01:48:15,780
you set me up now?

1668
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:19,950
where he's going on about he's
got he's talking to a bunch of

1669
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:23,700
educators and he makes a stupid
comments. And the Biden does

1670
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:26,610
under the bites the Biden clip,
first raid team that you would

1671
01:48:26,610 --> 01:48:27,570
all be proud of.

1672
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:32,430
And we're all ready to go and
doing an awful lot of work right

1673
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,370
now. But here's the thing that I
want to mention.

1674
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:42,480
You know, there's already a
circumstance where nationwide

1675
01:48:43,170 --> 01:48:48,420
because of the requirement of
school districts,

1676
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:50,970
county offices,

1677
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:56,460
mayors, governors having to
balance their budgets.

1678
01:48:57,510 --> 01:49:02,340
They've already had to layoff
666,000 teachers.

1679
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:11,220
666,000 teachers have been laid
off already since March. And,

1680
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:16,470
and I'm worried, Tony, that I
know in Noblesville, you have a

1681
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:20,580
force about 135 firefighters.
And

1682
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:25,110
the question is going to be when
do we have to start laying off

1683
01:49:25,110 --> 01:49:27,930
because the counties in the
cities don't have the money.

1684
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:32,610
They can't deficit spend they
have to spend based on balancing

1685
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:37,890
their budget when the first
responders and the fire service

1686
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,280
will be laid off? What was the
what was this recorded was the

1687
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:42,300
context of this.

1688
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:48,060
Talking to a bunch of locals
schmucks locals there, it's a

1689
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:54,060
zoom calls some sorting is
666,000 nuts bullcrap, but it

1690
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:54,990
turns out just look

1691
01:49:56,610 --> 01:50:00,000
good. The fact checkers could
find a way to rationalize it.

1692
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,330
Because Joe Biden will never be
factcheck false. Yeah, but we

1693
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:06,840
all heard the 666 we heard it.
We know what that we know what

1694
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:12,630
the idea is. Even it was 666. I
would have said 6687. Just to

1695
01:50:12,630 --> 01:50:14,190
just to not say it.

1696
01:50:15,299 --> 01:50:19,109
Yeah, that's what I would you
know, I agree I would do, but

1697
01:50:19,139 --> 01:50:24,119
wasn't 666 Anyway, it was like,
some half that if not, if less,

1698
01:50:24,449 --> 01:50:27,959
it, that's all people involved.
It's just a number cobbled

1699
01:50:27,959 --> 01:50:29,789
together just nonsense. Yeah.

1700
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:34,800
But why 6667 is a mark of the
beast. factcheck false. Yeah.

1701
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:40,770
So before we actually earlier
this week, the vo Jaiden was in

1702
01:50:40,770 --> 01:50:46,020
Georgia campaigning because we
have this to run off races which

1703
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:46,770
could determine

1704
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:52,560
the power in the Senate and thus
the power being the United

1705
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:55,080
States and the world. Quite
honestly, it comes down to too

1706
01:50:55,110 --> 01:50:59,400
to vote too little too little
runoff elections in Georgia.

1707
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:02,040
Here's what Joe had to say. In
the meantime, Biden was in

1708
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:05,490
Georgia Tuesday, where control
of the US Senate will be decided

1709
01:51:05,490 --> 01:51:09,690
by runoff elections next month.
You're voted as if your life

1710
01:51:09,690 --> 01:51:12,540
depended on it. Well, guess
what?

1711
01:51:13,650 --> 01:51:15,390
Now you're gonna have to do it
again.

1712
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:21,210
Okay, so we know what to expect
as already 75,000 new registered

1713
01:51:21,210 --> 01:51:24,720
voters for this runoff election.
Amazing. Good work, Stacey

1714
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:30,630
Abrams. And then Joe came out
after Tuesday, and claimed his

1715
01:51:30,630 --> 01:51:35,760
victory claimed his victory as
the according to him in the

1716
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:39,300
mainstream media. It's all done.
It's end you john. It's all

1717
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:42,510
done. It's in the can the
Electoral College has decided it

1718
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:42,870
is.

1719
01:51:43,950 --> 01:51:48,750
So ladies, gentlemen, welcome to
your brand new president. Good

political preference of
certified certified winning

1728
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:19,680
candidates.

1729
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:27,420
Certified today, member of the
of the Electoral College,

1730
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:31,950
representing the certified
winner cast their votes for

1731
01:52:31,950 --> 01:52:35,940
president and vice president
knighted states, and an act just

1732
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:40,950
as old as our nation itself.
Once again, the American America

1733
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:44,400
the rule of law, our
Constitution, and the will of

1734
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:48,540
the people prevail. our
democracy pushed, tested,

1735
01:52:48,930 --> 01:52:52,920
threatened, proved to be
resilient, true and strong.

1736
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,390
the electoral college votes
which occurred today reflect the

1737
01:52:57,390 --> 01:53:00,510
fact that even in the face of
the public health crisis, unlike

1738
01:53:00,510 --> 01:53:03,930
anything we've experienced in
our lifetimes, and now he's

1739
01:53:03,930 --> 01:53:06,570
really starts to fall apart.
We're only 16 minutes into the

1740
01:53:06,570 --> 01:53:11,700
speech, people voted a voted
record numbers were Americans

1741
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:14,640
voted this year, and they've
ever voted the history United

1742
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:19,710
States of America. Over 155
million Americans were

1743
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:23,430
determined to have their voices
heard, and their votes counted.

1744
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:26,280
Yeah, wait a minute. That's not
the falling apart. But it came

1745
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:29,730
later, when he had to deliver
the message. The final message

1746
01:53:29,730 --> 01:53:32,250
for the New World Order got
under control and getting the

1747
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:36,150
nation vaccinated against this
virus, delivering immediate

1748
01:53:36,150 --> 01:53:40,800
economic help so badly needed by
so many Americans are hurting

1749
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:46,890
day and then building our
economy back better was in doing

1750
01:53:46,890 --> 01:53:50,760
so we need to work together to
give each other a chance.

1751
01:53:59,370 --> 01:54:01,860
Now, that was the public
appearances where I think

1752
01:54:01,860 --> 01:54:05,400
everyone kind of noticed that
the president elect the office

1753
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:08,670
of the president elect was
coughing and stammering and was

1754
01:54:08,670 --> 01:54:12,630
not a great appearance. It was
15 minutes. just didn't feel

1755
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:16,710
really jubilant even though that
was the entire reason for it and

1756
01:54:16,710 --> 01:54:20,970
to bring you COVID could be I
mean, this would be the this

1757
01:54:20,970 --> 01:54:25,320
would be about the right time
for him to die. A guy can you

1758
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:29,550
imagine? Oh, no, I can really
imagine that. And again, it

1759
01:54:29,550 --> 01:54:33,660
would make a lot of sense,
because Camila is the puppet.

1760
01:54:34,050 --> 01:54:39,120
And Obama is the puppet master.
And he admitted this earlier

1761
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:43,770
when he was on cobit. This was I
think this was I don't know when

1762
01:54:43,770 --> 01:54:44,670
this was

1763
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:49,470
Obama admitted it won't listen,
it doesn't matter. He's still

1764
01:54:49,470 --> 01:54:52,560
admitting what he wants. Did you
miss you? Did you ever look at

1765
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,210
something going on in the news
and go you know what the

1766
01:54:54,210 --> 01:54:56,910
situation needs for Barack
Obama.

1767
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,670
Yeah, I've said this before I,

1768
01:55:03,810 --> 01:55:07,650
people would ask me, no one what
you know, now do you wish like

1769
01:55:07,650 --> 01:55:09,570
you had a sec, a third term?

1770
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:13,260
And I used to say,

1771
01:55:14,309 --> 01:55:17,669
you know, what if I could make
an arrangement where

1772
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:24,240
I had a, I had a stand in front
man or woman and they had an

1773
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:27,690
earpiece in and I was just in my
basement in my sweats, looking

1774
01:55:27,690 --> 01:55:31,740
through the stuff, and then I
could sort of deliver the lines,

1775
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:36,750
but somebody else was doing all
the talking and ceremony. I'd be

1776
01:55:36,750 --> 01:55:40,710
fine with that. Because I found
the work fascinating. Yeah.

1777
01:55:41,430 --> 01:55:44,970
Okay. They do like putting it
right in our face, don't they?

1778
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:49,980
You know, I never heard this
before. I want you to take take

1779
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:52,260
the clip of the day. Thank you.
I was kind of extending.

1780
01:55:55,230 --> 01:55:59,100
Yeah, yeah, pretty much. Yeah.
I'd be sitting in my basement

1781
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:01,680
when I was a little intercom if
be good to go.

1782
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:05,910
And it certainly wasn't
happening. When Joe had his

1783
01:56:05,910 --> 01:56:10,200
little, his his private zoom
conversation with

1784
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:15,120
the Democratic Party, a lot of
progressives were on this call.

1785
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:20,040
And, again, we have audio that
was leaked. I don't know if it's

1786
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:22,920
on purpose or not, it does show
a very different side of Joe,

1787
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:26,940
he's very assertive. Me, I don't
think he's cognitive. But he's

1788
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:29,760
very assertive in what he's
saying. We'll start with

1789
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:34,830
that people need to stop all
this negative talk. This is, I

1790
01:56:34,830 --> 01:56:38,820
believe, one of the progressives
on the zoom call, who was quite

1791
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:41,490
upset because if you look
around, you'll see

1792
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:48,420
the progressive wing, these
squad, ao C's, the Black Lives

1793
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:52,350
Matter. The black and brown
community protectors, they're

1794
01:56:52,350 --> 01:56:56,040
not seeing any love from, from
Joe with his cabinet

1795
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:58,740
appointments or anything. In
fact, I think people are waiting

1796
01:56:58,740 --> 01:57:01,920
for some money. But no, no, no,
Joe is going to push back real

1797
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:06,630
hard. And he's going to remind
us that he is the office of the

1798
01:57:06,630 --> 01:57:11,910
president elect, because of the
one big lie detailed, a lot of

1799
01:57:11,910 --> 01:57:14,310
people in our community are
getting a little anxious because

1800
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:17,310
they are not seeing enough of
the progress they thought they

1801
01:57:17,310 --> 01:57:20,940
would have seen at this point.
Let's not disappoint them. And

1802
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:25,020
let's not get to a place where
voters in Georgia begin to

1803
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:29,280
second guess. Okay, never mind.
I've got I've got to go. Let me

1804
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:31,920
respond. There's a lot to
respond to here. Let's get some

1805
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:34,920
straight. You shouldn't be
disappointed. What I've done so

1806
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:38,310
far is more than anybody else
has done this far. Okay, number

1807
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:43,260
one, number two. I mean, what I
say when I say it, all right. I

1808
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:48,150
mean, when I say when I say, All
right, I'm the only person who's

1809
01:57:48,150 --> 01:57:53,280
ever run on three platforms that
I was told could not possibly

1810
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:59,010
win the election. And I never
cease Trump won was on restoring

1811
01:57:59,010 --> 01:58:01,920
the soul of this country.
Because what I saw happen in

1812
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:06,450
Charlottesville, I was in no one
else was talking about it. The

1813
01:58:06,450 --> 01:58:11,640
words the President's matter.
Nobody else no progressive. was

1814
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:16,200
talking about? I did. Because no
one wanted to propagate that

1815
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:20,460
insulting ly Joe. He's talking,
of course, about the various

1816
01:58:20,850 --> 01:58:26,580
people. So he's rather This is
really a terrific clip. Because

1817
01:58:26,610 --> 01:58:31,230
he's like, taking credit for
winning by pride, but he thinks

1818
01:58:31,230 --> 01:58:34,320
is still doesn't know what that
it's a lie. Is that stupid?

1819
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:38,490
I think he's dead serious.
Ladies and gentlemen, your next

1820
01:58:38,490 --> 01:58:38,970
president.

1821
01:58:41,790 --> 01:58:44,850
Yeah, but there's more. There's
more, there's more. There's

1822
01:58:44,850 --> 01:58:47,850
more. He Joe was also not gonna
do anything.

1823
01:58:49,620 --> 01:58:50,130
Because now

1824
01:58:52,170 --> 01:58:55,200
now he has principles, his
principles are no executive

1825
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:56,160
orders, because

1826
01:58:57,210 --> 01:59:00,450
I don't know, something
Constitution, the Constitution.

1827
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:02,940
And so there's some things that
I'm going to be able to do by

1828
01:59:02,940 --> 01:59:07,020
executive order. I'm not gonna
hesitate to do it. But what I'm

1829
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:11,100
not going to do is I'm not going
to do what Euston binita, you

1830
01:59:11,100 --> 01:59:13,740
probably used to get angry with
me during the debates, when

1831
01:59:13,740 --> 01:59:17,040
you'd have some of the people
who were forced on day one, I'm

1832
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:20,370
gonna inject in order to do
this. Not within the

1833
01:59:20,370 --> 01:59:24,780
constitutional authority. I am
not going to violate the

1834
01:59:24,780 --> 01:59:25,830
constitution.

1835
01:59:26,850 --> 01:59:30,270
executive authority that my
progressive friends talk about

1836
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:34,980
is way beyond the bounds. And is
one of you said maybe you were

1837
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:38,190
ever ever now, whether it's far
left or far right.

1838
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:45,780
There is a constitution. It's
our only hope. Our only hope.

1839
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:48,960
And the way to deal with it is
where I have executive

1840
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:53,280
authority. I will use it to undo
every single damn thing. This

1841
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:56,820
guy's done by executive
authority. But I'm not going to

1842
01:59:56,820 --> 01:59:59,970
exercise executive authority,
where it's question right

1843
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,480
can come along and say, I can do
away with assault weapons.

1844
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:05,910
There's no executive authority
doing that.

1845
02:00:10,230 --> 02:00:13,560
So he's not taking away our
guns. He's not gonna override

1846
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:18,540
executive orders. Wow, no, no.
He said he's going to override

1847
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:21,870
all the undo everything Trump
did. And I'll bet money they

1848
02:00:21,870 --> 02:00:26,400
can't do it. Well, we know from
the Supreme Court ruling

1849
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:31,140
regarding DACA, that most of
these executive orders will have

1850
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:34,470
to remain in effect well into a
year or a year and a half into

1851
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:36,150
the next administration's term.

1852
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:41,760
It are structured that what's
the claim? Yeah. So I'm all in

1853
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:43,470
on that. That sounds hilarious.

1854
02:00:44,790 --> 02:00:47,010
Let me just see if I had any
more build back bed. Well, the

1855
02:00:47,010 --> 02:00:49,440
great reset and kind of talked
about that.

1856
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:53,850
Yeah, maybe we should get to
your special I've been very

1857
02:00:53,850 --> 02:00:56,190
excited about this. You teased
it in the newsletter. In fact,

1858
02:00:56,190 --> 02:00:59,190
you you you set the you set
yourself up for this on the

1859
02:00:59,190 --> 02:01:02,040
previous show. So everybody is
waiting with bated breath.

1860
02:01:22,530 --> 02:01:27,390
So I don't think you just may be
fearful that this will be a last

1861
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:33,270
last class Kaylee. So I think I
made probably one, I probably

1862
02:01:33,270 --> 02:01:36,870
made too many clips. Or I've got
like, six. You look like a no

1863
02:01:36,870 --> 02:01:37,860
agenda producer.

1864
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:45,060
Yeah, I do. Because I am. Yes.
Uh, now she got. She's more

1865
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:46,500
combative than before,

1866
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:50,400
which is good. But you did a
couple of things. Couple of

1867
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:53,280
things are kind of minor. And
for example, I want to play this

1868
02:01:53,310 --> 02:01:58,170
play a couple of minor ones that
were no big deal. She took three

1869
02:01:58,170 --> 02:02:01,470
or four questions on Trump. Is
it gonna get a shot? Is he gonna

1870
02:02:01,470 --> 02:02:04,410
get a shot? Is he gonna go on TV
and get a shot? Why

1871
02:02:05,730 --> 02:02:08,730
isn't he go on TV and get a
shot? Or first answer was I

1872
02:02:08,730 --> 02:02:12,120
didn't clip which was, Hey, he's
had COVID. Why does he need a

1873
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:15,240
shot kind of makes sense. So
this became he didn't want to

1874
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:18,600
get into too much of that. But
he needs a shot. He's got to get

1875
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:21,210
a shot on TV, according to these
people. And this is the calean

1876
02:02:21,210 --> 02:02:23,550
the Trump shot. This is a
classic answer. She gave it at

1877
02:02:23,550 --> 02:02:24,210
least twice.

1878
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:29,700
Example for Americans to give
them confidence doctors, Dr.

1879
02:02:29,730 --> 02:02:32,670
Fauci as well as the month of
slowly folks that today that

1880
02:02:32,670 --> 02:02:36,720
they think President Trump
should get the vaccine is a no,

1881
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:40,950
because for himself would be to
set an example. Will he do that?

1882
02:02:40,950 --> 02:02:44,730
Like why not do it just to show
Americans because he also wants

1883
02:02:44,730 --> 02:02:47,580
to show Americans that our
priority are the most most

1884
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:50,880
vulnerable, there will be some
senior administration officials

1885
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:53,460
taking it publicly to instill
that confidence. It is very

1886
02:02:53,460 --> 02:02:56,700
important. And the President No,
but you'll you'll learn in the

1887
02:02:56,700 --> 02:03:00,600
next few days who that is, those
individuals will be but they

1888
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:02,700
will be taking it publicly to
instill confidence. The

1889
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:05,910
president wants to send a
parallel message which is, you

1890
02:03:05,910 --> 02:03:08,310
know, our long term care
facility residents and our

1891
02:03:08,310 --> 02:03:11,340
frontline workers are paramount
and importance and he wants to

1892
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:14,820
set an example in that regard.
Yeah, me, me, me, me. Me. Me.

1893
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:18,240
Me. Me. Me. Yeah. So Trump, I
don't think Trump's gonna take

1894
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:21,480
the shot out and think he's,
he's had COVID Why would he take

1895
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:25,410
this shot? It makes no sense. I
mean, why would why would

1896
02:03:25,410 --> 02:03:30,360
anybody look at a celebrity or a
politician and think oh, yeah,

1897
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:34,140
that's the real shot. I can
never think this How could you

1898
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:39,060
ever believe a celebrate it? All
the time Tom Cruise. I think

1899
02:03:39,060 --> 02:03:40,170
that we believe him.

1900
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:47,700
Yeah, I'm in half agreement
except the true believers down

1901
02:03:47,700 --> 02:03:51,960
in Hollywood and there's plenty
of them. Block stepped up. Rob

1902
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:55,950
Reiner. Don't take the shot and
he'll take it real shot. I was I

1903
02:03:55,950 --> 02:03:59,580
was chatting with the with the
Zoomers.

1904
02:04:00,630 --> 02:04:05,940
And so the two highlights of so
far for them the past couple of

1905
02:04:05,940 --> 02:04:11,370
weeks has been not not not happy
Joe Biden got in but happy that

1906
02:04:11,370 --> 02:04:16,110
we got that horrible orange man
out. And that's the only day

1907
02:04:16,110 --> 02:04:19,560
like by me and it's like a merit
badge. It's like Haha, we did

1908
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:23,400
it. I'm so happy. I'm so proud
of us is fantastic. We made sure

1909
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:27,420
that he that horrible racist
scum of a human is not even

1910
02:04:27,420 --> 02:04:30,840
issues lower than human being
that he that he is not

1911
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:34,050
reelected. That was great. And
then the next thing is, and

1912
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:37,350
we've got a vaccine. I'm
scheduled for this week. How

1913
02:04:37,350 --> 02:04:41,070
about you? I'm so excited. Yay,
vaccine.

1914
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:48,540
So they're all in big Lee. Yeah,
okay. Well, that's fine.

1915
02:04:50,070 --> 02:04:53,850
A, see what happens. It's one
way of testing the thing. This

1916
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:57,420
whole idea, I think it's a great
way to test it. I mean,

1917
02:04:58,830 --> 02:05:00,000
true believers are going they're
getting

1918
02:05:00,030 --> 02:05:02,430
shot and see what happens
because this is not a normal

1919
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:06,180
shot. And if you'd wanted, I'm
not advising people not to get

1920
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:07,740
the shot, you need to know.

1921
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:12,510
But I want to see what happens.
Yeah, I'll hang back.

1922
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:17,280
Yeah, you can wait, what's the
rush? Yeah, well, you know, I

1923
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:19,680
don't think there's any COVID
going around anymore. That's

1924
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:23,130
just my opinion. Hello, that's
wrong. There's a new strain in

1925
02:05:23,130 --> 02:05:28,230
the UK. What are the new
science? science science? Okay,

1926
02:05:28,230 --> 02:05:31,680
so, here's another minor one.
This is Kate. Kaylee discussing

1927
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:34,020
something that's not discussed
by the mainstream media. I don't

1928
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:38,940
understand why not. But Trump is
gonna gonna veto the NDA.

1929
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:45,480
You don't want to wait. You
don't know why the media is not

1930
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:49,260
discussing the vetoes. It's the
media that you don't understand

1931
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:54,090
why they won't discuss this
veto, which I don't understand.

1932
02:05:57,210 --> 02:05:59,940
Specifically, when the President
will detail the National Defense

1933
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:02,400
Authorization Act, when he's
gonna send the paperwork over?

1934
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:05,670
And why would he do that, given
the fact that passed on veto

1935
02:06:05,670 --> 02:06:11,310
proof majorities. And so he
still does plan to veto. The NDA

1936
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:14,280
don't have a timeline for you on
that. But he does plan to veto

1937
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:17,760
it. He wants to make every
effort to protect our military

1938
02:06:17,790 --> 02:06:20,820
men and women on and will
prioritize military funding and

1939
02:06:20,820 --> 02:06:25,170
the big omnibus bill, but he
also has other important

1940
02:06:25,170 --> 02:06:28,500
priorities. And I should say
problems with the NDA beyond

1941
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:31,980
just the absence of Section 230.
repeal of and beyond the

1942
02:06:31,980 --> 02:06:34,590
inclusion of the war and
amendments on one of the

1943
02:06:34,830 --> 02:06:37,890
provisions of concern is troop
provisions about troop

1944
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:41,610
withdrawal and deployment in
Afghanistan, South Korea, and

1945
02:06:41,610 --> 02:06:45,180
Germany. And so there are a
number of provisions that he's

1946
02:06:45,630 --> 02:06:48,840
gone China but no republican
agreement on that. Why does he

1947
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:49,050
think

1948
02:06:50,190 --> 02:06:54,780
so by not including a section
230 repeal? What you're in

1949
02:06:54,780 --> 02:06:59,820
effect allowing is Twitter to
continue to not censor Chinese

1950
02:06:59,820 --> 02:07:04,230
propaganda. Recently, there was
a tweet by the US, the Chinese

1951
02:07:04,230 --> 02:07:07,650
Embassy in United States about
the shinjang province in

1952
02:07:07,650 --> 02:07:11,220
allowing all citizens to enjoy
the same rights, including

1953
02:07:11,220 --> 02:07:13,830
freedom of religion, that
clearly is not the case, as the

1954
02:07:13,830 --> 02:07:17,700
wiggers have been absolutely
tortured, in that province that

1955
02:07:17,700 --> 02:07:21,090
there was another tweet that
they allowed about the virus

1956
02:07:21,090 --> 02:07:23,910
originating in Wu Han, they said
it was not it did not originate

1957
02:07:23,910 --> 02:07:27,660
in Wu Han that obviously is
Chinese just information. And

1958
02:07:27,660 --> 02:07:29,850
the President's priority is to
ensure that that isn't

1959
02:07:29,850 --> 02:07:30,360
permitted.

1960
02:07:31,650 --> 02:07:36,510
So we've luckily talked about
this that I what I heard

1961
02:07:36,510 --> 02:07:39,720
initially is he wanted to
complete repeal of Section 230,

1962
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:43,290
which I would for selfish
reasons would be against because

1963
02:07:43,530 --> 02:07:46,950
we kind of run on that. So Luke
comes to no agenda social calm,

1964
02:07:46,950 --> 02:07:49,950
we don't want we need some
protection over what what what

1965
02:07:49,950 --> 02:07:51,390
people will say over there.

1966
02:07:53,430 --> 02:07:57,810
I would like I would like an
enforcement or I would like a

1967
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:02,700
modification perhaps.
Apparently, this thing was

1968
02:08:02,700 --> 02:08:05,280
passed in the House in the
Senate by enough people to be

1969
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:09,540
veto proof as they have to have
was it two thirds of the of the

1970
02:08:09,540 --> 02:08:14,160
Senate has been as is necessary
for the override. I you know, I

1971
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:17,460
thought it was 60%. But whatever
it is did this a lot different

1972
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:20,880
than being veto? This, by the
way wasn't discussed, but it's a

1973
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:25,920
lot different being veto proof,
and then actually overriding the

1974
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:29,820
veto, because I got to put your
hand up? Yes, you do. And

1975
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:35,400
what is that other thing that
they mentioned was also kind of

1976
02:08:35,400 --> 02:08:38,580
important. Shoot? Oh, is that?
Yeah, the troop drawdown This is

1977
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:41,700
your so the National Defense
Authorization Act is what that

1978
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:44,970
is. This is where a lot of
interesting things happen years

1979
02:08:44,970 --> 02:08:49,470
ago, the Smith mundt Act, which
forbids the American government

1980
02:08:49,470 --> 02:08:52,890
from property from using
propaganda on its own people was

1981
02:08:52,890 --> 02:08:56,790
repealed, which is a part of the
problem if you think about it.

1982
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:58,530
That was so that

1983
02:08:59,730 --> 02:09:03,120
Voice of America and all of its
online, you know, the the

1984
02:09:03,150 --> 02:09:06,180
broadcast Board of Governors,
which is the propaganda unit,

1985
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:08,130
Tucker Carlson, his dad was a
member

1986
02:09:09,150 --> 02:09:11,670
so that they can continue to
propagandize on the internet,

1987
02:09:11,670 --> 02:09:15,840
which some American citizens
might see, but now be probably

1988
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:19,740
more targeted towards American
citizens. That was so that's

1989
02:09:19,740 --> 02:09:23,640
that kind of stuff does pass.
And then we have the troop draw

1990
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:27,570
downs, which you know, it's I
have not read the entire NDA

1991
02:09:27,570 --> 02:09:31,080
this time around. Usually I get
to it, but you know, that they

1992
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:34,440
don't want to draw down the
troops the way the President has

1993
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:36,660
said that. He said, we're
bringing everybody home and they

1994
02:09:36,690 --> 02:09:39,600
go right into the nuts, the NDA
and they say now we're gonna

1995
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:43,020
leave people here and the people
there will close that base. And

1996
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:46,830
so they don't give a crap
Because ultimately, the not the

1997
02:09:46,830 --> 02:09:50,220
military itself, but the
military industrial complex

1998
02:09:50,310 --> 02:09:54,240
needs this bill. That is their
budget for the next year. What

1999
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:57,540
are they going to get to spend
and on on what doesn't even

2000
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:57,990
matter

2001
02:09:59,520 --> 02:09:59,880
but

2002
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,880
How much money can they pocket?
How much? How much money Can I

2003
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:09,000
grab? And and I agree that
propaganda certainly from the

2004
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:13,020
Chinese Communist Party is
damaging.

2005
02:10:15,809 --> 02:10:17,999
So let's listen to what she has
to say about the Russian

2006
02:10:17,999 --> 02:10:23,609
hackers. Could you comment on
the Russian hackers breaching

2007
02:10:23,609 --> 02:10:28,019
several federal agencies? How,
how serious was this breach? And

2008
02:10:28,019 --> 02:10:31,949
is the Trump administration
considering retaliate? Look, the

2009
02:10:31,949 --> 02:10:35,399
US government were aware of all
of these reports, we're taking

2010
02:10:35,399 --> 02:10:39,959
all necessary steps to identify
and remedy any possible issues

2011
02:10:39,959 --> 02:10:44,729
related to the situation. As one
step in that process. Sister has

2012
02:10:44,729 --> 02:10:48,269
issued an emergency directive on
Sunday night for all federal

2013
02:10:48,269 --> 02:10:51,149
civilian agencies to review
their networks for indicators of

2014
02:10:51,149 --> 02:10:55,319
compromise, and disconnect or to
power down solar winds or Eon

2015
02:10:55,319 --> 02:10:59,159
products immediately. So we are
taking a hard look on this and

2016
02:10:59,159 --> 02:11:03,869
obviously, take any sort of
cyber hacks very seriously. And

2017
02:11:03,869 --> 02:11:07,439
just one more question on Russia
since Russian President Vladimir

2018
02:11:07,439 --> 02:11:11,699
Putin has congratulated
President Elect Joe Biden any

2019
02:11:11,729 --> 02:11:16,259
any comments on that from the
Russian president? No comment on

2020
02:11:16,259 --> 02:11:18,419
that. I leave it to the
president to react to that. He

2021
02:11:18,419 --> 02:11:22,589
spoken to President Trump Not
that I'm aware. Yeah, man flag

2022
02:11:22,589 --> 02:11:23,279
what you're doing.

2023
02:11:25,410 --> 02:11:29,040
Yeah, they always slip that kind
of thing. And now, fairweather

2024
02:11:29,040 --> 02:11:30,900
friends Vladimir Putin is

2025
02:11:33,780 --> 02:11:34,800
doing man.

2026
02:11:36,180 --> 02:11:41,250
So let's listen to Kay Kaley go
off on swalwell. This is Jim.

2027
02:11:42,690 --> 02:11:45,750
Yes, I'm sure she had a lot to
say about him unfortunate that

2028
02:11:45,750 --> 02:11:49,950
it doesn't give much coverage in
the mainstream media. But I

2029
02:11:49,950 --> 02:11:52,770
guess we shouldn't be surprised
because in the last 24 or 48

2030
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:55,710
hours, there have been quite a
few stories that not gotten a

2031
02:11:55,710 --> 02:11:58,890
ton of coverage in the
mainstream media. As former

2032
02:11:58,890 --> 02:12:03,030
White House press secretary Ari
Fleischer said, bias is often

2033
02:12:03,030 --> 02:12:06,720
found in stories the press does
not cover. And last week, we

2034
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:10,170
found out that democrat
congressman Eric swalwell was

2035
02:12:10,170 --> 02:12:14,670
infiltrated by an alleged
Chinese spy, the spy cozied up

2036
02:12:14,700 --> 02:12:19,770
to swalwell raised funds for his
2014 campaign and even planted

2037
02:12:19,770 --> 02:12:23,610
an intern in his office and that
relationship continued until the

2038
02:12:23,610 --> 02:12:27,000
FBI briefed him in 2015. And
that was some very good

2039
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:30,990
reporting done by axios. But
after entangling with this spy

2040
02:12:30,990 --> 02:12:34,050
for years, swalwell
hypocritically went on to be one

2041
02:12:34,050 --> 02:12:37,800
of the lead instigators of the
Russia collusion hoax in the

2042
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:41,670
impeachment. Sham swalwell wrote
this on his congressional

2043
02:12:41,670 --> 02:12:45,210
webpage, President Trump and his
team are directly and indirectly

2044
02:12:45,210 --> 02:12:49,200
tied to Russia. That was not
true. He then said in September

2045
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:52,380
of 2020, the President has a
compromised relationship with

2046
02:12:52,380 --> 02:12:56,970
Russia on true April of 2019. He
said President Trump certainly

2047
02:12:56,970 --> 02:13:00,810
acts on Russia's behalf and acts
like Russia's leader, not true.

2048
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:04,740
January 2019. Eric's walls that
it's pretty clear President

2049
02:13:04,740 --> 02:13:08,100
Donald Trump is an agent of
Russia not true and swalwell

2050
02:13:08,100 --> 02:13:11,520
shamelessly claimed Donald Trump
Jr. and Jared Kushner had an

2051
02:13:11,550 --> 02:13:14,370
eagerness and a willingness to
work with the Russians during

2052
02:13:14,370 --> 02:13:18,900
the 2016 election. Again, it was
false in 2019. He falsely

2053
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:22,440
claimed this yet again when
inquired about collusion by

2054
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:26,040
reporter and these baseless
attacks were false yet covered

2055
02:13:26,040 --> 02:13:29,850
breathlessly by the media. There
was no coverage, however, of

2056
02:13:29,850 --> 02:13:33,180
swalwell being the one
implicated but not Russia, but

2057
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:37,050
China. In fact, the New York
Times website, as of this

2058
02:13:37,050 --> 02:13:40,500
morning had not one result for
Eric swalwell his ties to

2059
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:44,670
Chinese spies, not one result.
And when the swalwell story

2060
02:13:44,670 --> 02:13:48,900
broke, guess how many minutes of
coverage it got on ABC, NBC,

2061
02:13:48,990 --> 02:13:51,390
MSNBC and CBS zero

2062
02:13:54,150 --> 02:13:54,990
What?

2063
02:13:56,910 --> 02:13:58,410
Nah, man

2064
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:03,300
Where's Adam Schiff? He's got to
be on deck next for some of this

2065
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:07,020
awesome stuff with him because
he's, I mean, this would be his

2066
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:11,790
moment of triumphs You know,
we've beaten him orange man bad

2067
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:17,340
here I am. Everybody's up. Yeah.
There's a lot up with China that

2068
02:14:17,370 --> 02:14:20,100
are next year is gonna be great.
No matter who's president. We're

2069
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:24,570
gonna have a lot of China to
deal with. So here we go with we

2070
02:14:24,570 --> 02:14:27,540
got three left guy Kaylee's fact
check false.

2071
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:32,940
Hello, everyone. Hello noon.
Yesterday, the United States

2072
02:14:32,970 --> 02:14:38,040
witnessed a medical miracle. The
first doses of a COVID vaccine

2073
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:42,240
were administered to frontline
workers across the country. The

2074
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:45,750
President promised a safe and
effective vaccine and record

2075
02:14:45,750 --> 02:14:49,980
time and President Trump
delivered. Earlier this year, we

2076
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:53,460
heard from several news outlets
and so called fact checks that

2077
02:14:53,460 --> 02:14:58,020
President Trump would be quote,
a miracle to be right. That was

2078
02:14:58,020 --> 02:15:00,000
an NBC News article. We were

2079
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:03,990
Told according to health line,
quote, a vaccine will still take

2080
02:15:03,990 --> 02:15:08,790
more than a year to develop. USA
Today warned us that quote,

2081
02:15:08,790 --> 02:15:12,300
despite medical researchers
progress, the vaccine quote was

2082
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:17,040
more than a year away. And
National Geographic even told us

2083
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:20,880
that achieving a vaccine within
quote a year to 18 months would

2084
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:26,190
be absolutely unprecedented. And
quotes. These reports deserve

2085
02:15:26,190 --> 02:15:30,720
their own fact check. False.
fact check false. What's an

2086
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:34,140
interesting I'm realizing now
that whenever Kaley does one of

2087
02:15:34,140 --> 02:15:40,440
these press briefings, my inbox
is flooded with the backup

2088
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:42,420
material to back up what she
said.

2089
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:47,340
That's funny. It's where Yeah,
it's where I think a lot of this

2090
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:51,120
last bit and especially here
National Geographic even told us

2091
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:53,460
that achieving National
Geographic got to do with

2092
02:15:53,460 --> 02:15:55,830
anything? Yeah, I know. And I'll
get like look at National

2093
02:15:55,830 --> 02:16:00,120
Geographic did my fan quote a
year to 18 months? Oh, yeah.

2094
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:03,300
We're looking at Bill Nye, the
Science Guy said he said it

2095
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:04,770
would be two years for a
vaccine.

2096
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:11,880
It's like, okay, we get it.
Alright, so here's our on this

2097
02:16:11,880 --> 02:16:16,500
stuff. Now, there's now somebody
asked a question, a really

2098
02:16:17,190 --> 02:16:20,760
question that kicked her off.
This is a question of assault on

2099
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:23,640
democracy. Oh, yes. I love
these.

2100
02:16:24,900 --> 02:16:28,800
Thanks for President Trump
supporting the Texas lawsuit. At

2101
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:33,330
the Supreme Court and lawsuit
the president elect Biden called

2102
02:16:33,330 --> 02:16:37,170
an assault on democracy. How is
it not? Is it not anti

2103
02:16:37,170 --> 02:16:41,550
democratic to try to nullify 20
million votes? I think pursuing

2104
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:46,170
legitimate litigation through
the judicial system is in no way

2105
02:16:46,470 --> 02:16:49,710
assaulting democracy. In fact,
it's, it's using democrat

2106
02:16:49,710 --> 02:16:53,970
institutions in the manner. They
are to be used to pursue pursue

2107
02:16:53,970 --> 02:16:58,170
legitimate claims with sworn
affidavits and additional

2108
02:16:58,170 --> 02:17:01,950
evidence but I do think what is
an assault on democracy are the

2109
02:17:01,950 --> 02:17:05,400
four investigations into
President Trump over Russia

2110
02:17:05,400 --> 02:17:07,920
collusion that turned up
nothing. I mean, Moeller alone,

2111
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:13,110
you had 19 lawyers, 40 FBI
agents, 2800, subpoenas. 500

2112
02:17:13,110 --> 02:17:15,660
search warrants, millions of
taxpayer dollars all to find no

2113
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:19,380
collusion. And the investigation
into President Trump began far

2114
02:17:19,380 --> 02:17:22,590
before he was even elected
President of the United States

2115
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:25,770
and his Intel briefings in the
transition period where he's

2116
02:17:25,770 --> 02:17:29,160
been weaponized against him on
an insurance policy from Peter

2117
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:32,760
struck, was put in place against
this president prior to him

2118
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:36,540
being elected. That is what is
an assault on democracy. Hello,

2119
02:17:36,840 --> 02:17:37,290
God

2120
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:42,270
was waiting for

2121
02:17:44,250 --> 02:17:47,670
all these Kaylie clips and no
sound effects something's up.

2122
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:52,260
Right now we go to the finale
clip. And I have a little

2123
02:17:52,470 --> 02:17:55,140
comment after that, because I
have a little a little

2124
02:17:56,400 --> 02:17:59,310
I boost it a little bit so we
can hear something. But this is

2125
02:17:59,310 --> 02:18:02,370
Kaylee is finishing up and she
walks off the stage after this.

2126
02:18:02,370 --> 02:18:07,050
This is somebody is this the
hunter Biden commentary. Oh, I'm

2127
02:18:07,050 --> 02:18:07,530
sorry.

2128
02:18:09,690 --> 02:18:10,770
I got

2129
02:18:12,480 --> 02:18:16,170
an interesting pre election and
post election coverage to on the

2130
02:18:16,170 --> 02:18:21,300
hunter Biden scandal which was
not covered at all by many

2131
02:18:21,300 --> 02:18:25,170
outlets. And the lead up to the
election. In fact on October 15,

2132
02:18:25,170 --> 02:18:28,410
you had a New York Times
headline that said Trump said to

2133
02:18:28,410 --> 02:18:31,590
be warned that he was being
confirmed given Russian

2134
02:18:31,590 --> 02:18:36,060
disinformation over hunter
Biden. Now December 10. Just a

2135
02:18:36,060 --> 02:18:39,690
few months later, New York Times
headline investigation of hunter

2136
02:18:39,690 --> 02:18:42,810
Biden is likely to hang over
Biden as he takes office,

2137
02:18:43,230 --> 02:18:46,980
Washington Post on October 16.
That headline read the truth

2138
02:18:46,980 --> 02:18:50,310
behind the hunter Biden non
scandal. Now you have the

2139
02:18:50,310 --> 02:18:53,280
Washington Post headline that
says this hunter Biden tax probe

2140
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:57,330
examining Chinese business
deals. Political October 19.

2141
02:18:57,330 --> 02:19:00,210
Hunter Biden's story is Russian
disinformation that's a

2142
02:19:00,210 --> 02:19:04,560
favorite. Dozens of former Intel
officials say false yet again.

2143
02:19:04,710 --> 02:19:08,400
December 2 now Politico reads
Justice Department's interest in

2144
02:19:08,400 --> 02:19:12,390
hunter Biden covered more than
taxes really interesting turn of

2145
02:19:12,390 --> 02:19:15,600
events are in good for those who
covered what was the story all

2146
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:17,730
along and not Russia
disinformation.

2147
02:19:18,750 --> 02:19:21,060
you accuse others of
disinformation when you spread

2148
02:19:21,060 --> 02:19:21,600
it every day.

2149
02:19:23,640 --> 02:19:26,670
I think I heard what he said is
that your Is that what you have

2150
02:19:26,670 --> 02:19:29,070
here? Yeah, here's the bush you
can play play it again.

2151
02:19:30,930 --> 02:19:33,690
What do you want me to play the
booster the boosted one. Okay,

2152
02:19:33,690 --> 02:19:34,050
here we go.

2153
02:19:35,220 --> 02:19:37,530
you accuse others of
disinformation when you spread

2154
02:19:37,530 --> 02:19:43,770
it every day. Is that the CNN
douche? No. He says I don't I

2155
02:19:43,770 --> 02:19:46,170
listened to that voice a couple
of times. You know the guy he

2156
02:19:46,170 --> 02:19:49,470
normally does the gets Acosta
that sounds like a cost that to

2157
02:19:49,470 --> 02:19:53,820
me. It could be a cost of it, I
think is john. JOHN Robert

2158
02:19:53,910 --> 02:19:56,310
Roberts from ABC. Carl

2159
02:19:57,330 --> 02:19:59,520
from Fox listening

2160
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,520
critical for you to accuse
others of disinformation when

2161
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:06,390
you spread it every day. Yeah,
it's not a cost. No, it's not.

2162
02:20:06,990 --> 02:20:08,610
It's not I hear it now. It's not
a cost.

2163
02:20:09,809 --> 02:20:12,959
Well, john roberts is with Fox.
Yeah, that would make sense.

2164
02:20:15,179 --> 02:20:20,909
It but then but then to say, how
can you stand here and talk

2165
02:20:20,909 --> 02:20:22,949
about misinformation when you do
it every day?

2166
02:20:25,890 --> 02:20:29,880
Oh, my goodness, a chicken shit
thing to say whoever it was. And

2167
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:32,130
I don't know why these guys are
even in these briefings. They

2168
02:20:32,130 --> 02:20:35,700
should throw them out. I mean, I
think Obama threw a couple a

2169
02:20:35,700 --> 02:20:39,390
lot. I know bush did for sure.
No, no, no. Obama just spied on

2170
02:20:39,390 --> 02:20:43,410
them and threw them in jail. We
talking about the right way

2171
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:44,850
Trump learn these tricks.

2172
02:20:46,530 --> 02:20:49,050
nice guys finish last, I guess.

2173
02:20:50,130 --> 02:20:50,550
You know?

2174
02:20:51,630 --> 02:20:53,280
Well, that was it. So that may
be the

2175
02:20:54,810 --> 02:20:57,780
Daily Report. And maybe the last
we ever hear of Kaylee, ladies

2176
02:20:57,780 --> 02:20:58,260
and gentlemen.

2177
02:21:00,900 --> 02:21:05,160
JOHN C. Dvorak. Bakelite. Hi,
today's Teddy Kennedy. He's an

2178
02:21:05,160 --> 02:21:09,660
OTG kind of guy. Yeah, baby OTG.
We haven't had a report in a

2179
02:21:09,660 --> 02:21:12,780
while. And I do have some
information from the front lines

2180
02:21:12,780 --> 02:21:17,790
of the OTG wars. Although
really, are we talking about a

2181
02:21:17,790 --> 02:21:23,550
wars, there is a little bit of
war going on, as Apple is now

2182
02:21:27,270 --> 02:21:31,560
about to release all of these
features, that cut off a lot of

2183
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:34,950
the spying, not a lot, but a
significant portion of the

2184
02:21:34,950 --> 02:21:36,570
spying that apps do.

2185
02:21:37,590 --> 02:21:41,730
And Facebook is now trying to
garner some support for their

2186
02:21:41,730 --> 02:21:46,440
position because it's pretty
much their business. And I've

2187
02:21:46,440 --> 02:21:50,160
learned from a couple of
developers have been talking to

2188
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:53,880
this is honey pot kind of deal
that's going on with with the

2189
02:21:53,880 --> 02:21:58,860
app stores, and certainly the
apple, the iOS App Store, where

2190
02:21:58,860 --> 02:22:02,910
if you really want to get some
good data, some good statistics

2191
02:22:02,910 --> 02:22:07,080
on how people are using your
app, there's pretty much one

2192
02:22:07,080 --> 02:22:10,980
library. And that's the one that
everybody puts in there. And

2193
02:22:10,980 --> 02:22:14,550
what that does is it gives all
of your information, all of

2194
02:22:14,550 --> 02:22:18,090
those statistics to Apple, they
take it on the way going out to

2195
02:22:18,090 --> 02:22:22,890
Facebook, to the what's the big
aggregator, I forget who I think

2196
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:25,860
who bought them recently, and
Oracle by them or something, you

2197
02:22:25,860 --> 02:22:29,640
know, they combined credit card
data with online data. So yeah,

2198
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:33,870
I forgot myself. So that's so
Facebook is now saying, and of

2199
02:22:33,870 --> 02:22:36,960
course developers can get paid
for this information, either

2200
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:40,920
through ads or similar
mechanisms, if they install this

2201
02:22:41,730 --> 02:22:45,120
toolkit, and they get to see
what their users are doing.

2202
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:48,270
Facebook is saying this is
horrible, just horrible that

2203
02:22:48,270 --> 02:22:52,800
Apple's doing that this will
kill this will kill free apps.

2204
02:22:53,580 --> 02:22:58,680
Well, now, this is exactly where
I want to have. Yeah. Turns out

2205
02:22:58,680 --> 02:23:02,610
free is pretty expensive. I
think we learned that from you

2206
02:23:02,610 --> 02:23:08,610
Facebook. So well, Apple is is
trying. But they you know I'm

2207
02:23:08,610 --> 02:23:12,330
there so many sensors in these
phones. Now, so many things. I

2208
02:23:12,360 --> 02:23:15,990
mean, it's I don't want anyone
to ever see that I just can't

2209
02:23:15,990 --> 02:23:22,170
trust these guys. Enter graphene
OS which one of our producers

2210
02:23:22,170 --> 02:23:27,060
had sent me a pixel two months
ago, if you can remember, with

2211
02:23:27,060 --> 02:23:32,400
graphene OS, which is a D
googled pure Android, actually,

2212
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:35,970
it almost feels like this on
Linux, of course it is some

2213
02:23:35,970 --> 02:23:40,320
Linux in there. And I decided
upon this apple news since I was

2214
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:43,710
using the cloaked iPhone, the
old iPhone, I would give this

2215
02:23:43,710 --> 02:23:50,010
thing another shot. And I am
blown away by the level of

2216
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:53,910
permissions that you can set for
every single app, everything

2217
02:23:53,910 --> 02:23:59,610
that is happening. I love that I
didn't lose any functionality

2218
02:23:59,610 --> 02:24:03,720
really, other than I can
completely control all this crap

2219
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:08,190
that used to pop up and tell me
to do things and you're just not

2220
02:24:08,190 --> 02:24:11,820
being tracked by Silicon Valley.
And there's some great pie hole

2221
02:24:11,820 --> 02:24:16,950
like blockers, VPN blaze based
blockers in there. I've been

2222
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:21,060
really examining this for the
past week, and I think it is

2223
02:24:21,060 --> 02:24:27,480
going to replace my OTG flip
phone. Although, yep, yep. It's

2224
02:24:27,480 --> 02:24:31,110
going to replace it. Now. I'm
also I need to be able to send

2225
02:24:31,110 --> 02:24:35,340
text messages faster now.
Because I'm saving podcasting.

2226
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:37,680
So I do need to be able to
communicate and

2227
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:42,870
I am sick. Believe me. I'm
saving more than you realize.

2228
02:24:43,170 --> 02:24:45,630
But what's happening with pod?
I'm trying it's our own

2229
02:24:45,630 --> 02:24:49,920
preservation. Mr. devore. I
appreciate the the the the

2230
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:52,620
sentiment. I just don't
understand how this means you

2231
02:24:52,620 --> 02:24:54,300
have to send text faster.

2232
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:59,580
Well, because I communicate with
a lot of people

2233
02:25:01,020 --> 02:25:04,860
And I'm trying to orchestrate
and move pieces around. And so

2234
02:25:04,890 --> 02:25:08,850
if I'm, whether it's an email or
anything else, I do need to be

2235
02:25:08,850 --> 02:25:12,930
able to do this. Not just when
I'm in the house, because I'm

2236
02:25:12,930 --> 02:25:16,920
also out sometimes and even even
the newsletter, I'm in the

2237
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:19,650
newsletter to California where
they won't let you out.

2238
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:26,160
Well, who needs a phone? We can
live in California, right, john?

2239
02:25:27,180 --> 02:25:31,950
So I've decided I'm going to
give this a real go. But I'm

2240
02:25:31,950 --> 02:25:34,500
going to get a an upgraded
pixel.

2241
02:25:36,600 --> 02:25:41,580
And this is kind of fun. The
pixel four, which is still an

2242
02:25:41,580 --> 02:25:44,160
old phone, I mean, it's all it's
old compared to what they have

2243
02:25:44,160 --> 02:25:47,940
now. With graphene. Oh, s
generation old, the five is the

2244
02:25:47,940 --> 02:25:50,700
one they just released. Yeah,
but it's old. That's what I'm

2245
02:25:50,700 --> 02:25:54,480
saying. It's old. So now it's
old. It's not it's no longer

2246
02:25:55,290 --> 02:25:59,820
old. So you can you can buy them
for like 360 bucks in the box

2247
02:25:59,910 --> 02:26:04,320
unlocked? Well, it's doable. But
the same producer? Because, you

2248
02:26:04,320 --> 02:26:07,500
know, installing this graph he
knows is maybe not for the

2249
02:26:07,530 --> 02:26:12,060
uninitiated or weak at heart.
But however, luckily, if you go

2250
02:26:12,060 --> 02:26:16,560
to, can I stop you? Yeah. Can
this producer he knows who he

2251
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:20,100
is. He knows who I am. Can you
do this with a blue phone? which

2252
02:26:20,100 --> 02:26:23,340
they're only 75 bucks 80 bucks
for a good blue phone? They're

2253
02:26:23,340 --> 02:26:25,950
dynamite? Can you take and put
the graphene on there without

2254
02:26:25,950 --> 02:26:28,110
having to throw 300 bucks away
when you don't really need that

2255
02:26:28,110 --> 02:26:31,800
much if you're gonna bring it to
take and then reconfigure it

2256
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:34,950
anyway. Can you do it on another
android phone? Like a blue

2257
02:26:34,950 --> 02:26:38,580
phone? No, probably not Miami?
No, probably not. Oh, you don't

2258
02:26:38,580 --> 02:26:42,000
use? You're just saying that
you? No, no, no. Okay, you want

2259
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,010
to be an asshole? Probably.

2260
02:26:47,220 --> 02:26:50,640
No, you can't? I'm going to
answer the question. Instead of

2261
02:26:50,640 --> 02:26:54,570
you insulting me, because they
specifically build it for

2262
02:26:54,750 --> 02:26:58,980
certain types of phones, blue
phone, not one of them. And it's

2263
02:26:58,980 --> 02:27:02,880
all the pixels. And it's one
galaxy. And that's so there's

2264
02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:06,660
your answer. No. It's only for
specific devices. Don't tell me

2265
02:27:06,660 --> 02:27:12,060
I don't Well, I will stop you
again. Why don't they do it for

2266
02:27:12,060 --> 02:27:14,880
the cheap smartphones, like a
blue phone.

2267
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:18,930
Because I'm talking to you, I'm
talking to the developers.

2268
02:27:20,010 --> 02:27:24,690
Because the cheap blue phones
really are not applicable for

2269
02:27:24,690 --> 02:27:28,800
the integration that you want.
If you want everything to work.

2270
02:27:28,920 --> 02:27:31,440
See, it's it's not about that
you can get the software on the

2271
02:27:31,440 --> 02:27:34,440
device. But if you want the
screen to work, right, if you

2272
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:37,260
want the buttons to work, right,
this takes an incredible amount

2273
02:27:37,260 --> 02:27:41,940
of effort. And they just did it
on better devices. And not on

2274
02:27:41,940 --> 02:27:45,900
cheap pieces of crap because
people want good good phones.

2275
02:27:46,170 --> 02:27:50,520
But they don't want to have all
the tracking in there. That's

2276
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:55,620
why now if you want to if you
want to install some, some some

2277
02:27:55,620 --> 02:27:58,560
other operating system on top of
Android on your blue phone, you

2278
02:27:58,560 --> 02:28:02,880
can there's things out there,
but I can't vouch for this. This

2279
02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:07,740
is the first one I'll vouch for
good news, though. If you go to

2280
02:28:07,740 --> 02:28:13,890
no agenda phone.com you can send
your phone directly to our

2281
02:28:13,890 --> 02:28:17,040
producer and he will do all the
flashing for you and set it on

2282
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:21,300
there. Will he do it? Does he
charge? Not for you and I but he

2283
02:28:21,300 --> 02:28:24,690
will for everybody else and
maybe charge? I don't know.

2284
02:28:25,380 --> 02:28:28,980
Okay. Guide because I presume
I'm not sure he says send me the

2285
02:28:28,980 --> 02:28:31,680
phone. But I was looking for
this guy. I couldn't find him

2286
02:28:32,040 --> 02:28:36,780
through through searching. If I
know agenda phone.com like Oh,

2287
02:28:36,780 --> 02:28:41,370
wait a minute, I sent an email.
This the same guy. So this is

2288
02:28:41,370 --> 02:28:44,940
the this is the look when I get
my new one. I'll send this one

2289
02:28:44,940 --> 02:28:47,190
to you. So you can you can play
with it. How does that sound?

2290
02:28:49,620 --> 02:28:52,320
Oh, that'd be great. But wait a
minute.

2291
02:28:53,460 --> 02:28:57,390
Okay, I'm not going to look at
gift horse in the mouth. I would

2292
02:28:57,390 --> 02:29:00,360
like to play with it. I would
like to know, I assumed

2293
02:29:00,360 --> 02:29:03,450
questions immediately. Okay, I
am curious about this. I know

2294
02:29:03,450 --> 02:29:07,350
you're asking. I know you are.
Can you use the navigator? Yes.

2295
02:29:07,410 --> 02:29:12,630
It has what? Yeah, hold on.
There's an open source program.

2296
02:29:13,470 --> 02:29:18,090
And it's called the opening it
now. It's called I think it's

2297
02:29:18,090 --> 02:29:24,810
called you are here. And now you
can obviously you can completely

2298
02:29:24,810 --> 02:29:30,450
lock down your, your GPS, what
apps are using it. But this

2299
02:29:30,450 --> 02:29:33,570
thing works pretty well. It's
based on Open Street maps. It

2300
02:29:33,570 --> 02:29:37,830
has a very clunky dude voice in
there. So you know

2301
02:29:37,830 --> 02:29:39,900
counterculture. Let's make a
completely different from

2302
02:29:39,900 --> 02:29:41,640
anything else. No women, just
men.

2303
02:29:43,140 --> 02:29:47,400
And I tried it out just a little
bit yesterday works well. So

2304
02:29:47,400 --> 02:29:50,610
yes, you can and the maps are
not bad. I mean, it's not going

2305
02:29:50,610 --> 02:29:53,010
to do traffic routing for you.

2306
02:29:54,780 --> 02:29:58,830
Well, you can add that but that
is uh, let me make a few

2307
02:29:58,830 --> 02:29:59,430
comments.

2308
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:04,830
To pad this report, first of
all, the original mapping that

2309
02:30:04,830 --> 02:30:09,090
went on at both Apple and
Google, they had some licenses

2310
02:30:09,090 --> 02:30:11,670
from somebody that really had
good maps when they first came

2311
02:30:11,670 --> 02:30:14,790
out. They were dynamite, they
could try to chase you around,

2312
02:30:14,790 --> 02:30:17,310
they never made you, you turn,
you turn your tune, you you

2313
02:30:17,310 --> 02:30:20,520
turn, you turn, where they are.
Now, it's not even a U turn,

2314
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:23,490
they wrap you around a bunch of
cities, you know streets to get

2315
02:30:23,490 --> 02:30:25,560
you back the other way, when
they could say you turn to be

2316
02:30:25,560 --> 02:30:30,780
easier. And then it slowly
deteriorated to the point where

2317
02:30:30,780 --> 02:30:35,130
the maps are really lousy. I
think Garmin, I think Garmin was

2318
02:30:35,130 --> 02:30:37,680
giving them their maps. And you
remember Apple had the big

2319
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:42,480
fiasco with with maps, and they
had to pretty much start Yeah,

2320
02:30:42,480 --> 02:30:47,520
they kill the old deal, the fire
the guy who was responsible for

2321
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:52,590
it, and they had to pretty much
recreate the entire Apple Maps,

2322
02:30:52,590 --> 02:30:55,380
it was horrible. Remember people
driving into the water and

2323
02:30:55,380 --> 02:30:59,160
stuff? Yes, the water drive it
through? Yes, I remember that.

2324
02:31:00,420 --> 02:31:04,470
So the new a new mapping scheme
that might have some might be

2325
02:31:04,470 --> 02:31:08,220
better actually, than the
current situation. I mean, I, I

2326
02:31:08,220 --> 02:31:13,230
try not to use a navigator at
all, I try to keep my brain. I

2327
02:31:13,230 --> 02:31:17,250
agree, I take it I got funny got
j to take it off. Because now

2328
02:31:17,250 --> 02:31:19,440
people are driving to the store,
you know, they've been to a

2329
02:31:19,440 --> 02:31:22,860
million times have turned to
navigate around. I try not to I

2330
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:25,920
tried never to use it. Except
when I'm in a pinch.

2331
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:32,730
The what is remarkable is the
speed of it. Just how fast

2332
02:31:32,730 --> 02:31:35,370
things snap. And you can you
know, it's like it's almost like

2333
02:31:35,370 --> 02:31:38,520
Linux, where you can control a
lot of these things and make it

2334
02:31:38,580 --> 02:31:42,150
even faster than it already is.
But in general,

2335
02:31:43,860 --> 02:31:46,680
you're not gonna have a lot of
douchebag apps that you don't

2336
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:50,220
need that are tracking you
anyway. And you get your K nine

2337
02:31:50,220 --> 02:31:54,000
mail, which is good and open
source and proven to not be

2338
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:57,450
spying on you. Believe me, a lot
of those great email apps you

2339
02:31:57,450 --> 02:32:02,880
get from the App Store for free.
Hello. Free is expensive people.

2340
02:32:03,090 --> 02:32:06,330
So that's graphene OS I'm
excited about it. And and with

2341
02:32:06,330 --> 02:32:10,230
this with the upgraded version,
the wait for it, you can plug in

2342
02:32:10,230 --> 02:32:11,370
an external monitor

2343
02:32:12,630 --> 02:32:16,950
and floating windows, so you can
perhaps use it very much like a

2344
02:32:16,950 --> 02:32:17,610
desktop.

2345
02:32:18,690 --> 02:32:23,940
just plugging into a USB see the
USB C port and an outputs video.

2346
02:32:27,480 --> 02:32:32,370
Wow, yeah. And I've already I've
already tried it. The pixel

2347
02:32:32,370 --> 02:32:35,460
doesn't do the pixel two doesn't
do it. But it was very

2348
02:32:35,460 --> 02:32:39,000
interesting to hook up a
Bluetooth keyboard, Alt Tab

2349
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:43,530
works. It's just goes through a
different app that's open in

2350
02:32:43,530 --> 02:32:49,590
email, you know, control our
reply Ctrl S and it's like, holy

2351
02:32:49,590 --> 02:32:54,690
crap. It's kind of good.
Everything. I was surprised,

2352
02:32:54,690 --> 02:32:59,130
very subversive product. Yes, it
is. It is.

2353
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:04,680
So I will keep you up with this.
Be honest about it. I when you

2354
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:07,500
install anything on any one of
these smartphones, it says can

2355
02:33:07,500 --> 02:33:10,260
we get permissions for this and
that new your contact list? We

2356
02:33:10,260 --> 02:33:13,260
want this we want that they want
all these things? Like there's

2357
02:33:13,260 --> 02:33:16,830
no reason to have these these
programs want me my contact

2358
02:33:16,830 --> 02:33:21,660
list? No, there's, there's no
ask for any of that. Now, there

2359
02:33:21,660 --> 02:33:26,340
is something called APK pure,
which means you can get the

2360
02:33:26,340 --> 02:33:30,450
Android packages that might be
on the order would typically be

2361
02:33:30,450 --> 02:33:34,140
in a in a in the Google Play
Store. You can get them without

2362
02:33:34,140 --> 02:33:37,830
all the Google stuff in it. But
if you I mean, I always have to

2363
02:33:37,830 --> 02:33:40,770
laugh. Yeah, get signal. It's
encrypted. It's great. Well, I

2364
02:33:40,770 --> 02:33:43,680
understand how some app that is
supposed to keep you safe and

2365
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:47,370
encrypted and your identity
hidden, refuses to work unless

2366
02:33:47,370 --> 02:33:50,130
you allow it to take your
address book.

2367
02:33:51,390 --> 02:33:55,350
I mean, hello. It doesn't work
unless you let it upload your

2368
02:33:55,350 --> 02:33:58,380
address book. So there's a
possibility for someone to

2369
02:33:58,380 --> 02:34:03,180
compile relationships for sure.
So that's what I would hope that

2370
02:34:03,180 --> 02:34:05,760
these guys who do graphene and
they start thinking about this

2371
02:34:05,760 --> 02:34:10,020
sort of things. This is the way
brave operates the browser,

2372
02:34:10,590 --> 02:34:13,320
where they give they get bogus
information. You want my address

2373
02:34:13,320 --> 02:34:15,750
book, yeah, here and they give
you a blank book.

2374
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:19,740
Right, but but it won't
function. It won't actually fun.

2375
02:34:19,740 --> 02:34:23,370
No, but it will if it asks for
your address book that could

2376
02:34:23,370 --> 02:34:28,620
only book OS won't ask for it.
No, I'm just saying the app.

2377
02:34:29,400 --> 02:34:32,580
Right if you have an OSC I mean
brave does this is a browser,

2378
02:34:32,610 --> 02:34:36,720
the browser level it gives bogus
information? Yes. Oh, yeah. I am

2379
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:43,620
a I'm functioning as a Chrome
browser when it's not. I'm also

2380
02:34:43,620 --> 02:34:47,040
Oh, yeah, no, I you can track me
here is where the information

2381
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:51,180
would go in and it puts it off
into oblivion. Things like that.

2382
02:34:51,180 --> 02:34:53,370
I don't see why that can't be
done. Just generally. Yeah.

2383
02:34:53,370 --> 02:34:55,710
Well, that sort of thing says
you have to give me your address

2384
02:34:55,710 --> 02:34:58,590
book. Okay. I'll give you my
address book and you give them

2385
02:34:58,590 --> 02:35:00,000
an address book which What is it

2386
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:03,150
Not your address book. It's just
not phony. Yeah, I mean,

2387
02:35:03,150 --> 02:35:06,030
unfortunately, the whole app
just won't work at all. If

2388
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:09,390
I mean, if you want, it thinks
it's got an address book, it

2389
02:35:09,390 --> 02:35:13,200
will know you can't contact
anyone. If you don't have, if

2390
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:15,480
you haven't connected your
that's just a signal, I'm just

2391
02:35:15,480 --> 02:35:19,680
telling you signal doesn't work
unless you give it access to

2392
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:22,590
shows on personnel I try to
contact your signal has to be in

2393
02:35:22,590 --> 02:35:24,450
my address book that I gave to
them.

2394
02:35:25,560 --> 02:35:29,790
It has to be in your address
book on your device. You cannot

2395
02:35:29,790 --> 02:35:33,330
give it access to that unless
you give it access to it. And

2396
02:35:33,330 --> 02:35:37,260
then it uploads it. So yeah, you
can't just enter a number and

2397
02:35:37,290 --> 02:35:40,470
and have signal work. It will
not work unless you let it

2398
02:35:40,470 --> 02:35:44,220
access your contacts. It's
ridiculous. Well, I'm That's

2399
02:35:44,220 --> 02:35:47,820
what I'm saying. Why can't you
give it a bogus? Because you

2400
02:35:47,820 --> 02:35:51,870
need the actual number? Should
have to be in there. Yeah, you

2401
02:35:52,170 --> 02:35:57,360
Jhansi devorah? I would have to
have 415, whatever. Yeah. So I'm

2402
02:35:57,360 --> 02:36:00,810
just asking these questions.
Because I have a lot of people I

2403
02:36:00,810 --> 02:36:04,410
call on different systems.
They're not in my address book.

2404
02:36:04,410 --> 02:36:06,480
I just happen to have their
number and I call them and then

2405
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:08,430
they see you I put in the
address book. Now I don't feel

2406
02:36:08,430 --> 02:36:08,850
like it.

2407
02:36:09,900 --> 02:36:13,260
But with signal that it has to
be they check to make sure that

2408
02:36:13,260 --> 02:36:15,780
it's actually in the address
book. I can't just call you out

2409
02:36:15,780 --> 02:36:18,150
of the blue or something right?
The blue correct.

2410
02:36:19,590 --> 02:36:23,340
There's no good. No, it's not.
So these things are not to be

2411
02:36:23,340 --> 02:36:24,000
used.

2412
02:36:27,780 --> 02:36:31,050
It has real it's I'm just very
impressed. I like it, I didn't

2413
02:36:31,050 --> 02:36:34,260
think that I would be able to
work fast enough on it. I didn't

2414
02:36:34,260 --> 02:36:37,830
think that it would have all the
features. The only thing and

2415
02:36:37,830 --> 02:36:42,420
this is a downside for me. The
only thing it doesn't do is low

2416
02:36:42,420 --> 02:36:47,370
energy, low Bluetooth energy or
Bluetooth low energy to hearing

2417
02:36:47,370 --> 02:36:50,880
aids. So I have to wear I have
to have a Bluetooth dongle in

2418
02:36:50,880 --> 02:36:53,280
between which is just hanging
around my neck. And it

2419
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:55,800
communicates with the hearing
aids and you just connect to the

2420
02:36:55,800 --> 02:36:59,790
phone with Bluetooth. Otherwise,
yes, and I've got like a dorky

2421
02:36:59,790 --> 02:37:00,450
necklace.

2422
02:37:01,950 --> 02:37:05,940
Hey, man, I'm off the grid. Look
at my cool necklace. Says put a

2423
02:37:05,940 --> 02:37:07,470
shark's tooth on it. You'll be
fine.

2424
02:37:08,880 --> 02:37:13,560
Be very dumb. Anyway, uh, no
agenda phone calm. You can learn

2425
02:37:13,560 --> 02:37:14,940
more about it. And

2426
02:37:16,410 --> 02:37:20,850
I'm gonna. Well, I was going to
here's another thing I was going

2427
02:37:20,850 --> 02:37:25,170
to buy one on Amazon. And guess
what the worst possible thing

2428
02:37:25,170 --> 02:37:28,620
that could happen around
Christmas time happened? my

2429
02:37:28,620 --> 02:37:30,720
credit card got yanked got
stolen.

2430
02:37:31,770 --> 02:37:36,120
Yeah. So I had the best possible
thing that could happen. It's

2431
02:37:36,120 --> 02:37:37,170
horrible.

2432
02:37:39,390 --> 02:37:45,420
I only have one credit card. And
Tina has now she has an she has

2433
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:48,990
a backup that she I don't know
if her if her new name is on. So

2434
02:37:48,990 --> 02:37:52,440
how did this this explain how
this happened? I got a text

2435
02:37:52,440 --> 02:37:56,880
notification from from my bank.
And it said fraud alert. Are you

2436
02:37:56,880 --> 02:38:02,340
trying to buy something for
$162? From fashion? nova.com?

2437
02:38:04,110 --> 02:38:07,950
Yes, if you say yes, then they
will, then it will have to then

2438
02:38:07,950 --> 02:38:10,770
the purchase can be made left to
run it again. If you say no,

2439
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:15,000
then your credit card will be
cancelled. It will close

2440
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,700
immediately. And we'll have to
send you a new one five to seven

2441
02:38:17,700 --> 02:38:21,270
business days. No. So what are
you going to do? You can't say

2442
02:38:21,270 --> 02:38:26,280
yes. By the way, fashion.
nova.com is like a store for

2443
02:38:26,280 --> 02:38:32,430
lingerie. Like Like, but like
not a high end one. So clearly,

2444
02:38:32,580 --> 02:38:35,850
just the testing to see if it
works and the show suck it out.

2445
02:38:35,850 --> 02:38:39,900
You still have your card in on
your person? Oh, yeah, no, this

2446
02:38:39,900 --> 02:38:41,640
is just the number. I don't
know, they got the number

2447
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:43,920
somewhere. I'm thinking solar
winds.

2448
02:38:45,660 --> 02:38:50,340
Oh, who knows? We got all kinds
of you know, when Google goes

2449
02:38:50,340 --> 02:38:57,840
out Gmail, Google Docs drive,
YouTube. When AWS goes down, I

2450
02:38:57,840 --> 02:39:00,060
start to get suspicious of stuff
happening.

2451
02:39:03,900 --> 02:39:07,530
And well, and what's interesting
what you got, and why you got

2452
02:39:07,530 --> 02:39:12,720
that? Well, here's another one
for you. Why is it that visa

2453
02:39:14,280 --> 02:39:21,060
said they will no longer process
payments for Pornhub until they

2454
02:39:21,450 --> 02:39:25,410
address the concerns of the
quote unquote, legitimate

2455
02:39:25,410 --> 02:39:32,700
content and Pornhub who cannot
survive without VISA credit card

2456
02:39:32,700 --> 02:39:34,020
transaction clearing

2457
02:39:35,160 --> 02:39:39,960
they immediately set to work
deleted 60% of their videos

2458
02:39:39,960 --> 02:39:46,140
which were deemed a legitimate.
Here's my question. Why only

2459
02:39:46,170 --> 02:39:46,770
Pornhub

2460
02:39:48,390 --> 02:39:52,980
there are plenty of other porn
sites that do transactions and

2461
02:39:52,980 --> 02:39:57,000
take credit cards. Why only
Pornhub Why? But So you're

2462
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,610
telling me I'm just reading
between the lines.

2463
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,310
That your credit card was stolen
from Pornhub

2464
02:40:06,930 --> 02:40:10,410
that did not come out well. What
I was trying to get to is that

2465
02:40:10,410 --> 02:40:14,640
hunter Biden had been uploading
his personal porn videos to

2466
02:40:14,670 --> 02:40:18,570
Pornhub and I have a feeling
that there needed to be a purge

2467
02:40:18,570 --> 02:40:21,330
to make sure that none of other
things that he may have been

2468
02:40:21,330 --> 02:40:27,150
involved with surface to the top
on Pornhub Oh, these are the

2469
02:40:27,150 --> 02:40:31,170
things that I start to look at
like Oh really? We have we have

2470
02:40:31,170 --> 02:40:36,090
solar winds happening Amazon
goes down we have Google

2471
02:40:36,570 --> 02:40:41,430
multiple servers is going down
and then Pornhub has to as only

2472
02:40:41,610 --> 02:40:45,240
company has to purge a lot of
their content. Will you tell me

2473
02:40:45,240 --> 02:40:46,350
this? I'm not going on?

2474
02:40:49,050 --> 02:40:54,120
Well, time is up. But I do like
your analysis. And I lost my

2475
02:40:54,120 --> 02:40:55,050
credit card. I'm

2476
02:40:56,280 --> 02:40:57,930
gonna show my school by Jonah

2477
02:40:59,790 --> 02:41:02,160
evil who could do Oh Yeah,
that'd be fine.

2478
02:41:09,570 --> 02:41:13,050
Oh, and we do have a few people
to thank for show true 13 before

losh Kumari, insane. In India,
in India. Now that's impossible.

2543
02:46:15,060 --> 02:46:19,350
That's impossible. We had one I
think it was either Kumar or

2544
02:46:19,350 --> 02:46:23,160
somebody else. And I know it's
not possible because you can't

2545
02:46:23,160 --> 02:46:27,990
send money from India. Oh, to
paypal. So I don't know how he

2546
02:46:27,990 --> 02:46:28,680
did this.

2547
02:46:29,880 --> 02:46:33,960
Well, he may be an imposter note
and explain it. I think he's I

2548
02:46:33,960 --> 02:46:37,140
agree with you. We have people
from India, although it could be

2549
02:46:37,140 --> 02:46:39,330
the people from India bitching
that they can't send money or

2550
02:46:39,330 --> 02:46:41,430
just using it as a bogus excuse.

2551
02:46:42,810 --> 02:46:45,840
Now you're talking with the
Indians? Is that what you're

2552
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:49,680
saying? That cheapskates Well,
we've known they admit to it

2553
02:46:49,710 --> 02:46:50,760
them in the French?

2554
02:46:51,870 --> 02:46:52,980

02:47:11,940 --> 02:47:15,300

2668
02:54:42,510 --> 02:54:45,990
Now you're talking if you're an
expat stuck in Lithuania and do

2669
02:54:45,990 --> 02:54:48,960
not want to spend your Christmas
Eve alone. I propose a protest

2670
02:54:48,960 --> 02:54:51,690
together with the rest of the no
agenda global slave community by

2671
02:54:51,720 --> 02:54:56,040
eating tangerines and shell Tina
together, which is probably some

2672
02:54:56,040 --> 02:54:58,710
Lithuanian thing. That's
disgusting. You know what this

2673
02:54:58,710 --> 02:54:59,970
is shell Tina shell tea

2674
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,550
Have you ever heard of this?
Never heard of it?

2675
02:55:03,600 --> 02:55:04,590
Hmm. So

2676
02:55:07,109 --> 02:55:12,809
here we go. Shell Tina. No. Yes
sh ALTNA

2677
02:55:14,280 --> 02:55:17,730

look at

2678

2681
02:55:28,350 --> 02:55:30,840
the like head cheese

2682
02:55:32,010 --> 02:55:32,610
Really?

2683
02:55:33,780 --> 02:55:37,110
Okay, it's an aspect dish that
looks like yes she's to me.

2684
02:55:37,290 --> 02:55:40,860
Okay, that's not attractive. Not
no question. I don't even want

2685
02:55:40,860 --> 02:55:43,950
to hear about head cheese.
Really? It's not doesn't sound

2686
02:55:44,190 --> 02:55:44,820
attractive.

2687
02:55:47,370 --> 02:55:52,380
Yes, and then we have the New
Year's small amygdala bash 719

2688
02:55:52,380 --> 02:55:56,100
Colorado on New Year's Eve,
December 31. These are the no

2689
02:55:56,100 --> 02:55:59,880
agenda protests. They are
meetups in disguise make sure

2690
02:55:59,880 --> 02:56:03,000
you go and check one out you
will love it. You'll have a good

2691
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:06,660
time. And if feather isn't one
near you go set one up no agenda

2692
02:56:06,660 --> 02:56:07,500
meetup.com

2693
02:56:30,810 --> 02:56:34,260
All right. Let's see where we
are. Yeah, time to go. So I have

2694
02:56:34,260 --> 02:56:38,040
one last clip. Do you have
something to play us out? two

2695
02:56:38,040 --> 02:56:40,980
clips. I've got two clips. All
right. goody, goody goody.

2696
02:56:42,240 --> 02:56:42,840
Uh

2697
02:56:43,860 --> 02:56:46,710
I don't know which one to go
once about air pollution killing

2698
02:56:46,710 --> 02:56:52,050
a kid. And the other one is
about terrorism is back. Well,

2699
02:56:52,050 --> 02:56:55,740
let's think we can start with
the kid both up uplifting Yes.

2700
02:56:56,280 --> 02:56:59,610
very uplifting. Shall we go with
the dead dead dead kid first the

2701
02:56:59,610 --> 02:57:03,390
dead kid story as an uplifting
thing to leave with. And now I

2702
02:57:03,390 --> 02:57:07,770
want to preface this this is a
story that is a creation because

2703
02:57:08,610 --> 02:57:12,240
they make it sound as though
they kind of ignore the great

2704
02:57:12,240 --> 02:57:15,240
Russia the Russian the great
London Fog I think was in

2705
02:57:15,240 --> 02:57:20,130
1955 33 sir like that? Yes.
Which literally literally killed

2706
02:57:20,130 --> 02:57:23,850
a number of people hundreds. I
think I had to look it up. But a

2707
02:57:23,850 --> 02:57:26,370
lot of people most of the air
pollution laws around the world

2708
02:57:26,370 --> 02:57:26,820
are written

2709
02:57:28,200 --> 02:57:32,580
or created because of that
London Fog the death fog but no

2710
02:57:32,580 --> 02:57:36,120
No, no, we did current air
pollution which as far as I can

2711
02:57:36,120 --> 02:57:39,960
tell is borderline non existent
compared to what it was

2712
02:57:40,470 --> 02:57:43,380
apparently just killed a kid and
now they made a story out of it.

2713
02:57:43,410 --> 02:57:46,860
I think this is just a prelude
for some global climate change

2714
02:57:46,860 --> 02:57:49,950
thing, but let's play the clip.
nine year old Ella kissy Deborah

2715
02:57:49,950 --> 02:57:54,030
wanted to be a pilot and fly
around the world. Instead she

2716
02:57:54,030 --> 02:57:57,150
left her mark on it today a
London coroner ruled Ella's

2717
02:57:57,150 --> 02:58:01,920
death was caused in part by air
pollution. A historic first air

2718
02:58:01,920 --> 02:58:05,490
pollution is a pandemic her
mother Rosamond spent seven

2719
02:58:05,490 --> 02:58:08,760
years fighting for the
designation. Hopefully it means

2720
02:58:08,760 --> 02:58:12,000
governments everywhere will do
something for the for the

2721
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:16,470
citizens who are breathing
filthy Desi air. The oldest of

2722
02:58:16,470 --> 02:58:19,230
three, Ella walked to school
along one of London's most

2723
02:58:19,230 --> 02:58:23,910
congested streets diagnosed with
severe asthma at age six. After

2724
02:58:23,910 --> 02:58:29,190
seizures and 27 trips to the
hospital. She died at nine. I

2725
02:58:29,190 --> 02:58:34,680
hope never again will any child
suffer? way my daughter did. The

2726
02:58:34,680 --> 02:58:38,250
World Health Organization
estimates air pollution causes 7

2727
02:58:38,250 --> 02:58:42,330
million premature deaths a year.
What do you think Ella would

2728
02:58:42,330 --> 02:58:45,120
think of all of this? I think
she would just smile at this.

2729
02:58:45,330 --> 02:58:49,020
She would like the idea that
she's helping other young people

2730
02:58:49,020 --> 02:58:51,450
for a child who left too soon.

2731
02:58:52,470 --> 02:58:53,550
Well, this reminds me

2732
02:58:54,630 --> 02:58:55,380
of that.

2733
02:58:56,520 --> 02:58:57,720
Wait, let's do the jazzy one.

2734
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:06,630
Second insert

2735
02:59:12,810 --> 02:59:18,210
second insert. So the kid was
sick. The kid had all kinds of

2736
02:59:18,210 --> 02:59:22,950
issues. Oh man, we're just so
dry area but no, this is this is

2737
02:59:22,950 --> 02:59:26,250
the mind control. This is what
they do to you. This is what

2738
02:59:26,250 --> 02:59:26,670
they do.

2739
02:59:27,720 --> 02:59:31,980
More coming, not less more
coming. He Well the good news,

2740
02:59:32,010 --> 02:59:34,470
which I thought was good news
because Biden's gonna come in

2741
02:59:34,470 --> 02:59:37,530
they're getting it back to the
old ways. Let's go back to four

2742
02:59:37,530 --> 02:59:42,240
years ago, where we didn't know
if no one's noticed this. During

2743
02:59:42,240 --> 02:59:45,540
the last four years under Trump.
terrorism has not been a story

2744
02:59:45,540 --> 02:59:48,840
there's been no real six week
cycle that's gotten any try to

2745
02:59:48,840 --> 02:59:51,960
get back to the old days build
back better they get back to the

2746
02:59:51,960 --> 02:59:54,870
old days because terrorism was a
lot of fun to deal with and

2747
02:59:54,870 --> 02:59:59,640
here's the terrorism is back
baby clip on NBC. The FBI says

2748
02:59:59,640 --> 02:59:59,970
the plot

2749
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:03,360
came from Al Shabaab, the al
Qaeda offshoot in Africa that

2750
03:00:03,360 --> 03:00:07,230
killed 72 people at a shopping
mall in Kenya seven years ago.

2751
03:00:07,650 --> 03:00:10,260
Investigators say the group was
incensed by the Trump

2752
03:00:10,260 --> 03:00:13,890
administration's decision to
move the US Embassy in Israel to

2753
03:00:13,890 --> 03:00:18,060
Jerusalem and plot it to attack
Americans in response, including

2754
03:00:18,060 --> 03:00:21,150
a plan to hijack a commercial
airplane and crash it into what

2755
03:00:21,150 --> 03:00:25,050
us skyscraper. Court documents
say a Kenyan man cholo. OBDII,

2756
03:00:25,050 --> 03:00:28,050
Abdullah enrolled in a flight
school in the Philippines three

2757
03:00:28,050 --> 03:00:31,710
years ago, and did research on
how to hijack a plane how to get

2758
03:00:31,710 --> 03:00:34,770
a US visa and look for
information about the tallest

2759
03:00:34,770 --> 03:00:38,280
buildings here. tipped off by US
intelligence agencies.

2760
03:00:38,280 --> 03:00:42,120
Philippine police arrested him
in July 2019. with intense

2761
03:00:42,120 --> 03:00:45,270
coverage by local media. He was
brought to the US to face

2762
03:00:45,270 --> 03:00:48,090
terrorism charges and appeared
today in the New York City

2763
03:00:48,090 --> 03:00:51,630
courtroom. The FBI says tonight
it's a reminder that overseas

2764
03:00:51,630 --> 03:00:54,750
terror groups remain committed
to attacking Americans and are

2765
03:00:54,750 --> 03:00:58,890
still obsessed with hijacking
airplanes. Oh, this is

2766
03:00:58,890 --> 03:01:03,240
fantastic. We are on track we
are going back in time which

2767
03:01:03,240 --> 03:01:05,400
means we can roll out the old
jingles

2768
03:01:09,690 --> 03:01:16,410
Shabaab yeah baby al Shabaab is
Broadway This is all the things

2769
03:01:16,410 --> 03:01:21,120
al Shabaab I am so sure that Al
Shabaab and African terrorist

2770
03:01:21,120 --> 03:01:26,760
group really gave a crap about
moving the embassy sure that's

2771
03:01:26,760 --> 03:01:29,610
what it was all about. That was
all they're preoccupied with it

2772
03:01:29,610 --> 03:01:33,240
over there. And Kenya I got
nothing better to do a move the

2773
03:01:33,240 --> 03:01:35,940
embassy Oh my god, this is the
most important thing in our

2774
03:01:35,940 --> 03:01:40,740
lives is bom bom of an American
building. Yeah, that makes

2775
03:01:40,770 --> 03:01:44,550
nothing but sense. What is what
is the general view of Milton

2776
03:01:44,550 --> 03:01:47,370
Friedman? What is your view of
Milton Friedman maybe a better

2777
03:01:47,370 --> 03:01:51,090
question. Milton Friedman picked
up that there's an economic

2778
03:01:51,090 --> 03:01:57,030
cycle. And after each collapse
of the economy, which happens, a

2779
03:01:57,030 --> 03:02:01,410
new theories need to be
developed, that are that explain

2780
03:02:01,410 --> 03:02:05,040
everything from the from the
last collapse, which is never

2781
03:02:05,040 --> 03:02:07,320
explained by the current
economist. But as explained by

2782
03:02:07,320 --> 03:02:09,960
some new guy that comes with
this new gap, as the guy's been

2783
03:02:09,960 --> 03:02:12,150
saying this for a while. And
then he becomes in high

2784
03:02:12,150 --> 03:02:15,840
prominence. He developed the
supply side economics theories,

2785
03:02:16,260 --> 03:02:19,380
and became very important and
he's the one probably

2786
03:02:19,380 --> 03:02:23,610
responsible what was called
Voodoo economics by George Bush.

2787
03:02:23,910 --> 03:02:28,170
But in fact, he was the leading
economist until he died pretty

2788
03:02:28,170 --> 03:02:32,490
much and but he's not good, but
his explanations for things

2789
03:02:33,090 --> 03:02:36,060
probably won't explain what
happens next. But somebody had

2790
03:02:36,060 --> 03:02:40,680
to explain stagnation. Right.
He's the one who did stagnation

2791
03:02:40,680 --> 03:02:44,610
or stagflation. Obviously,
stagflation. Yeah, you're right.

2792
03:02:44,700 --> 03:02:47,670
Good catch. But yeah, he he
explained that away. And he had

2793
03:02:47,670 --> 03:02:52,200
all these these all these theses
about how things really operate.

2794
03:02:52,200 --> 03:02:57,540
And he's I really like him. Oh,
good. Well, I have a clip from

2795
03:02:57,540 --> 03:03:01,110
1999 that I ran across that I
thought you might enjoy, I think

2796
03:03:01,110 --> 03:03:05,940
that the internet is going to be
one of the major forces for

2797
03:03:05,970 --> 03:03:09,870
reducing the role of government.
The one thing that's missing but

2798
03:03:09,870 --> 03:03:15,660
that will soon be developed is a
reliable ecash method whereby on

2799
03:03:15,660 --> 03:03:20,160
the internet, you can transfer
funds from A to B, without a

2800
03:03:20,160 --> 03:03:21,870
knowing B or B knowing

2801
03:03:25,170 --> 03:03:27,990
all hell is gonna break loose
and you're gonna need a bit.

2802
03:03:30,660 --> 03:03:34,830
Friedman predicts the Bitcoin.
He does, and I wish I had heard

2803
03:03:34,830 --> 03:03:37,140
that before and I would have
bought some bitcoins at 25

2804
03:03:37,140 --> 03:03:40,800
cents. You can still get in
john, let's go on to 400,000

2805
03:03:42,930 --> 03:03:46,440
in our lifetime, he probably
will go to 250 I don't think

2806
03:03:46,440 --> 03:03:46,590
he's

2807
03:03:48,990 --> 03:03:52,560
gonna collapse. No, it's not
gonna collapse. But all the

2808
03:03:52,560 --> 03:03:54,990
institutions are getting and
everybody wants a piece of the

2809
03:03:54,990 --> 03:03:55,380
action.

2810
03:03:57,150 --> 03:04:00,840
Nick the rock coming up next on
no agenda stream.com we

2811
03:04:00,840 --> 03:04:03,810
appreciate the work that we got
from our end of show remixers

2812
03:04:03,810 --> 03:04:08,520
Jesse coy Nelson and Professor
JJ with some original lyrics and

2813
03:04:08,520 --> 03:04:12,690
nice Christmassy vibe. And we
will return with more Christmas

2814
03:04:12,720 --> 03:04:16,560
cheer for you. Like kids dying
of pollution and

2815
03:04:18,510 --> 03:04:23,220
vaccine side effects all the
good stuff on Sunday. So until

2816
03:04:23,220 --> 03:04:26,640
then, coming to you from
opportunity zone 33 here in the

2817
03:04:26,640 --> 03:04:29,370
capital, the drone Star State
Austin, Texas FEMA Region number

2818
03:04:29,370 --> 03:04:33,270
six on the governmental maps in
the morning, everybody. I'm Adam

2819
03:04:33,270 --> 03:04:36,330
Curry. I'm from Northern Silicon
Valley where I can look at and

2820
03:04:36,330 --> 03:04:40,110
see the freeway filled with cars
driving around when they're

2821
03:04:40,110 --> 03:04:43,110
supposed to be at home. I don't
get it, but then it is what it

2822
03:04:43,110 --> 03:04:46,260
is. I'm just here. We return on
Sunday right here on no agenda,

2823
03:04:46,260 --> 03:04:53,010
remember us@devora.org slash na
until then adios mopho goes in

2824
03:04:53,010 --> 03:04:53,670
such

2825
03:04:55,080 --> 03:04:58,290
a way to keep it from us being
able to be in a position where

2826
03:04:58,290 --> 03:04:59,760
you can manipulate the machines

2827
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:04,230
Like, the one way to do that is
I think we should pass a federal

2828
03:05:04,230 --> 03:05:09,000
law mandating that the same
machines with paper trails be

2829
03:05:09,180 --> 03:05:11,820
mandatory for every federal
elections in a nutshell, it

2830
03:05:11,970 --> 03:05:15,750
should be mandated that we have
a paper ballot with a

2831
03:05:15,750 --> 03:05:16,980
standardized machine

2832
03:05:19,980 --> 03:05:21,090
Dominion voting systems.

2833
03:05:25,920 --> 03:05:29,460
Dominion CEO john flows
testified that there was no vote

2834
03:05:29,460 --> 03:05:32,520
for being no rank choice voting
and that the voting machines

2835
03:05:32,520 --> 03:05:35,400
were not connected to the
internet. There were no switched

2836
03:05:35,460 --> 03:05:38,790
or deleted votes involving
Dominion machines with Nokia

2837
03:05:38,790 --> 03:05:41,790
says my nose grows now he is
either lying or not. There are

2838
03:05:41,790 --> 03:05:44,820
no algorithm that enabled
fractional voting, he is not

2839
03:05:44,820 --> 03:05:47,760
lying, then his statement is
either true or false. There are

2840
03:05:47,760 --> 03:05:51,390
no evidence and voting machines
were not corrupted to alter this

2841
03:05:51,420 --> 03:05:54,510
election, therefore, either his
nose does not grow now or his

2842
03:05:54,510 --> 03:05:57,840
nose has grown out. Attorney
Sidney Powell responded saying

2843
03:05:57,840 --> 03:06:01,140
that the votes are counted from
the images Dominion creates the

2844
03:06:01,140 --> 03:06:03,960
balance, not the ballots
themselves. She said these

2845
03:06:03,960 --> 03:06:07,170
images are a part of her fraud.
The other two voting system

2846
03:06:07,170 --> 03:06:11,700
companies used by Michigan heart
voting systems and SNS declined

2847
03:06:11,700 --> 03:06:15,360
to attend the hearing. We have
put together the most extensive

2848
03:06:15,360 --> 03:06:19,560
and inclusive voter fraud
organization in the history of

2849
03:06:19,650 --> 03:06:20,820
American politics.

2850
03:06:29,100 --> 03:06:32,610
Good Maxine, and if you do a
public key to inspire confidence

2851
03:06:32,610 --> 03:06:35,820
to the people that can mean he
said he is absolutely open to

2852
03:06:35,820 --> 03:06:38,580
taking it you will receive the
vaccine as soon as his medical

2853
03:06:38,580 --> 03:06:42,390
team determines its best but his
priority is frontline workers

2854
03:06:42,390 --> 03:06:44,730
those long term care facilities
and he wants to make sure that

2855
03:06:44,760 --> 03:06:47,160
vulnerable kits are access
first.

2856
03:07:10,830 --> 03:07:12,780
Walk your dogs

2857
03:07:30,360 --> 03:07:31,110
every piece

2858
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:50,430
vaccine trials with indemnity

2859
03:08:04,680 --> 03:08:06,450
they will inject you

2860
03:08:12,120 --> 03:08:37,950
every 192

2861
03:08:40,740 --> 03:08:45,600
like the sheep say many times
many ways

2862
03:09:02,820 --> 03:09:07,020
mopho vortec.org slash n A.

2863
03:09:08,070 --> 03:09:10,410
Why is this so small?
