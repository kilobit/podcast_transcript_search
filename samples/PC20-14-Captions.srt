00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,589
podcasting 2.0 for December
4 2020, this is episode number

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,499
14. We've got stats and facts.

3
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:12,629
No the board meeting

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,670
on another Friday looking at
what's been going on with

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,140
podcasting 2.0 I'm Adam curry in
Austin, Texas and that guy you

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,920
see over there the Brad Pitt
look like it's the guy for

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,560
breakfast, Mr. Dave Jones.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,150
Wow.

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,720
This is a special is such a very
special episode of podcasting.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,760
2.0 I'm really excited to be
here.

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,010
What makes it so special just
because you're here.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:49,170
You don't remember. This is the
this is the 14th with a 14 week

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,100
anniversary of

14
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,770
Oh, honey, I forgot our 14 week
aversary I'm so sorry.

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,630
It's like when you're when your
girlfriend or whatever it is.

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,290
Yeah, the young love girlfriends
like you don't you don't

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,930
remember this is the first place
we watched the sunset together.

18
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:14,400
I remember those. But I often
Yeah, if I mess up on the on the

19
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,990
month of bursaries. What don't
you remember this is this was

20
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,620
our first date that was that
day, like down to the day? Yeah.

21
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,130
Like, well, I can't remember how
many years ago and I remember I

22
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,890
remember the date. But I don't
remember the you know, the exact

23
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,880
day,

24
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:32,759
I get a little fuzzy when we get
when we had to start parsing

25
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,809
time time zones.

26
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,850
Exactly. Was that in Lake Como
in Italy? Darling. I'm sorry. I

27
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,820
forgot. I really can't recall
the time zones.

28
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,320
For 1414 weeks into this and
we're we're cruising we

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,150
are. We are in cruising. I am. I
am so jacked about a number of

30
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,140
things that are happening right
now. And the first he jacked

31
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,880
about what I was jacked about
right off the bat is I the

32
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:08,880
community chapter idea. with,
you know, for, for chapters, and

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,420
I'm taking the two apps that
that are implement or have

34
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,050
implemented chapters that works
for me, in this case is hyper

35
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,420
catcher, and pod friend, because
it's like an additional

36
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,900
slideshow to the actual podcast.
And I found one of our producers

37
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,480
of the no agenda show. Sir, now,
Duke Dred Scott, and he raised

38
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,470
his hand and he said, Actually,
he I think he because I'd said

39
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,170
on the show, Hey, can you help
out with some chapters? Yeah,

40
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,550
just kind of off the cuff type
thing. Grab, grab hyper capture,

41
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,800
and I think I tweeted at once or
twice, and a couple people

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,160
checked it out. Because in hyper
capture, you can actually add

43
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,330
chapters while listening to the
show, which is such a, it seems

44
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,670
like such a simple concept that
you use the same application for

45
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,540
viewing listening as you do for
editing and for adding. Sounds

46
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,330
really nice. Yeah. And so that
shows up in the back end. Now my

47
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,470
problem is after three and a
half hours, you know, I can just

48
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,860
now barely remember after doing
the feed and all this crap,

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,380
which comes after, you know,
post production, and I need to

50
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,540
get my stuff out quick, you
know, I can't wait around for a

51
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,030
couple days. You know, I can
drag it over to otter.ai to get

52
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,430
the transcript rolling, which
have to remember to come back

53
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,570
because it takes a couple hours.
But then it's like if I'm gonna

54
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,710
do chapters like now I can't I'm
sick of myself. I can't hear

55
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,070
myself and go listen for another
three and a half hours. I tried

56
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,950
writing down time codes. No,
none of it works. And I just

57
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,860
don't i don't have that
capacity. It breaks your rule of

58
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,260
no post. Well, exactly. I yeah,
certainly no editing, you know,

59
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,440
anything, just, you know,
patching it up and getting it

60
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:59,580
out. So he had I think he showed
up on podcast index dot social.

61
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:04,050
And he had a question about the
hyper chat app and David was

62
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,840
helping him out and then I sent
him a DM I said, you know, bro,

63
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,290
do you want to just get you
know, get an account so you can

64
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,190
manage the whole thing and then
you can add images and go crazy

65
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,160
with it. And he said, Oh yeah,
sure. I'd love to do that. So

66
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,490
now what's happened if you look
at the last two no agenda

67
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:25,650
episodes Holy crap, it's filled
with images funny stuff, phone

68
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,670
boy is adding his no agenda
quotes with time codes, all of

69
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,200
this fantastic. additional
content that's being put in and

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,980
anybody can contribute. So you
know, anyone can still get hyper

71
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,890
capture and I think Martin may
be working on this for pod

72
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,590
friend. I think that it somehow
it should be some kind of

73
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,400
requirement that you that you
are able to this even just a

74
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,210
small bits of feedback. It makes
your app very unique.

75
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,890
I'm looking at it right now.

76
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,200
And I thought of another thing
and I think he

77
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,470
knows bill Frank for Microsoft
being

78
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:02,579
See, I mean, there you go,
you're laughing because it's

79
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:06,389
funny additional content. I love
that when people can contribute

80
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:12,689
in that way. And I was thinking,
since just as an aside, because

81
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:15,779
you know, the chapters, it's
like, Alright, if you're just

82
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:18,779
listening and you look at the
screen, a funny image pops up.

83
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,469
And you could do to time code
and the host could even refer to

84
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:26,249
it, or, you know, you can use it
as Oh, I want to, you know, skip

85
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:30,359
ahead to this segment, you can
tap on it. Well, if a if a

86
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:34,379
podcast app already has the
transcript, can't you then also

87
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:37,349
in the app, should you be able
to perform a search on that

88
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:42,149
transcript, which I would say
presumably, is already sucked

89
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:46,499
in? I don't know if the app does
it progressively. Or if they

90
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:50,849
suck, if it downloads the whole
SRT file? I mean, the Can you

91
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:54,299
then say, I'm searching for
this, and then it says, okay,

92
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:57,959
tears, five time codes, where
that comes up. And here's a

93
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,109
sentence and you just tap it
into goes to that spot in the,

94
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:03,029
in the, in the podcast,

95
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,360
that's complicated. And that
that's requires database, full

96
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,360
text search. So you would need
something like Elastic Search

97
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:22,020
server, or we Sphinx, there's a
few different Full Text Search

98
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,920
server products out there, you
know, open source and various

99
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,170
things. But you have to have
something like that, because the

100
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,040
transcript is humongous. And if
you're talking about, you know,

101
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,510
lots and lots of transcripts,
that's going to get big real

102
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,860
fast. Now, I mean, it's sort of
the same problem with the person

103
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,000
search, because you end up
having to vacuum up all of the

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,140
description fields of every of
every episode. And I mean, you

105
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:58,320
see a 50 million 50 million
episodes, and potentially and

106
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,480
let's just, you know, some
percentage of them have a

107
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,410
transcript and

108
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,900
they can't we just put this on
the blockchain. Yeah. Shame.

109
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,640
Come on, fix at all.

110
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,100
It doesn't even matter which
blockchain just the blockchain,

111
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,790
the blockchain, just the
blockchain, put it on there. You

112
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,970
don't

113
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,130
have to put it on there. You
just say you're going to and

114
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,840
then, okay, I think is fixed.

115
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,250
So in my simpletons, so I
understand what you're saying.

116
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,190
And I was immediately thinking
while you were speaking, is this

117
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,500
something the index could
provide? But now I'm like, holy

118
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,190
crap, no, no, this, this could
be a huge additional project,

119
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,910
which I think is basically what
Apple is now trying to do with

120
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,980
their transcripts. Yeah,

121
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,080
they're making that search.
They're doing it from the full

122
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,530
audio, the way they're meant to
tell me if I'm wrong, but I

123
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:48,240
think they are actually doing
the speech to text conversion to

124
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,200
get the transcript, and then
they're parsing, like they're

125
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,100
indexing that I don't even think
you have to have a transcript in

126
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,330
your, in your feed.

127
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,010
Oh, fuck those guys.

128
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,280
Well, but see, but I think it's
gonna, but it's gonna be crap

129
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,980
anyway, because, like, if
they're using the same if

130
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,580
they're using the same speech to
taste technology that Siri uses,

131
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,590
that's not an exciting future.

132
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,690
No, but even hotter, does a
pretty crappy job at a lot of

133
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,500
the transcripts, you know, it's
all kind of minimal. It's just I

134
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,520
know how easy it is. Here's the
quote, here's how I'm equating

135
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,440
it in my head. If I go to, if I
go to the show notes for no

136
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,420
agenda show, I have copy pasted
the transcript file into that

137
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,140
page in the outline. And you can
do an on page search. And it'll

138
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:42,120
it'll, it'll basically highlight
where that hit is. And it's,

139
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,710
it's, of course, it's not regex.
It's just a pure JavaScript on

140
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:51,180
the page search is very, very
fucking basic. So it can, you

141
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,640
know, it'll pick up words that
are separated by another word,

142
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,990
but that's about it. And then
there's the time code. And so I

143
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,020
do that, if I want to find
something in a particular

144
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:07,020
episode, I go to that page, I do
a Ctrl F, and I search for the

145
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,290
words, it's just an on page
JavaScript search, I see the

146
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,770
time code, then I go to my app,
or play or whatever I am. And I

147
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,460
forward to that timecode. And
I'm thinking, well, this is

148
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,670
dumb, because this can be this
obviously, this can be

149
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,270
automated. And I was just
wondering if it's possible in

150
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,290
that rudimentary fashion, so not
an overall search across all of

151
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,830
these things, but in one
episode, I just want to search

152
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,450
that one SRT file and then be
able to click on that one time

153
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,570
code in that one podcast that
I'm playing at that moment, if I

154
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,050
switch podcast, it flushes the
cache of the SRT

155
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,250
Okay, okay and understand you
now because typically as a

156
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,670
typical it the developer
whatever you want to call it,

157
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,100
me Yeah, you first you said it's
difficult and then you made it

158
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,470
sound like only you could do it
and then it was gonna cost me a

159
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,640
lot of money. Yes, that was

160
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:04,140
exactly Do warp 8.40

161
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,560
Wait, they

162
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,350
can. This is exactly what it is.
This is why CEOs fail because

163
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,450
they don't understand this one
dynamic.

164
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:16,349
Never set, you never tell them
exactly how long it's gonna

165
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,139
take, you know, it's just gonna
cause you always overshoot. And

166
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:21,089
then when you come in under it
your hero,

167
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:23,609
it's good to have an edible
before the show. This is

168
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,360
I think, no, I see what you mean
now. So like that. Yeah, yeah.

169
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,670
Cuz then you're just talking
about like a straight, you know,

170
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,300
I don't know how many thousands
of lines? Right. That's that's

171
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,540
the

172
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,740
thinking. Because what I've
noticed, and this is my job is

173
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:48,270
to notice these things. Is that
the the thrill? The I'm going to

174
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,240
use the word I don't use it
lightly the awesomeness of

175
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,430
podcasting 2.0. is these
interactions you do with the

176
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:03,210
app? Yes, that's, that's like
Boehner time, because we're

177
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:10,110
double cream. So where this
really shines, both in

178
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:19,200
excitement in a dopamine rush,
and in actual value, which we'll

179
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,680
be talking about in actual
digital money. boosting is

180
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:31,170
phenomenal. I mean, yeah, so
especially when people also

181
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,200
listening to a podcast, if you
haven't done this, if you listen

182
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,990
to the show, for the first time,
get seeds you can get on Sphinx

183
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,120
chat, Sphinx dot chat, and then
find some of these podcast

184
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,970
tribes. Because you can boost as
a as a seal of approval, a

185
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,420
number your discretion, which is
part of the fun. I used to have

186
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:57,300
1337 for leet. And then I saw my
wallet dwindling, and I changed

187
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,860
it for a four shot. That

188
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,100
was a great one. Thank you. And
it's very identified. Marty,

189
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:10,500
that tells from over to the no
agenda tribe in did 13 Oh, yes,

190
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:10,590
I

191
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,670
saw that. I saw that. I saw
that. And what's crazy, I saw it

192
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,300
come in on the index node, you
know, the one percentage? Yeah,

193
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,140
like what is going on here? This
is, that was beautiful. It's

194
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,250
beautiful. But it's that stuff.
And then that being of some

195
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:32,490
value for analysis for the
podcaster. So in the in the

196
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,540
chapters case, it's Oh, my God,
this is, you know, look at all

197
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,340
this cool additional crap that
was just created. In the book,

198
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,990
we talked about the transcripts,
which gives the listener

199
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,930
something to do like, I'm
looking for this. And by the

200
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,200
way, I'm a heavy user of this,
because I'm always looking for

201
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,650
what we're talking about, I
gotta go find this. And it's a

202
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,640
huge value. For you,

203
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,650
it could be a value for other.
Okay, so just think about, yeah,

204
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,990
no, no agendas, unique
situation, because you have an

205
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,060
army of producers that most

206
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:13,050
isn't really, you know, core, is
that what podcasting? 2.0 is?

207
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,200
Yes, I think that's Yeah, okay.
It's a good point. Because

208
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,970
podcasting 2.0 the whole
paradigm could mean what we're

209
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,520
trying to do we talk about it in
terms of our you know, value for

210
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,330
value, and in, in flipping that
model in and you get, you get

211
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,390
kind of sidetracked into the
money part of value for value.

212
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:36,720
But if, if, if our goal is to
revolutionize podcasting, into

213
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,780
podcasting, 2.0 across the
board, yep. And that would

214
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,860
encompass like every show,
having a small or some various

215
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,580
size army of producers that are
related, are able to do those

216
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:47,970
things.

217
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,610
I speak from some modicum of
standing, that every podcast has

218
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,590
listeners who are doing stuff
for that show, which I just for,

219
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:07,050
for simplicity, say they're a
producer, whether it's promoting

220
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,890
the show, this is, you know, you
should be able to wish in, you

221
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,880
know, in most podcast apps, hey,
I can promote this at this time

222
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,610
code. And I can tweet it right
away. And, you know, you get in

223
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,120
one case, you get Martin, snazzy
little timeline player, which is

224
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,710
just a piece of joy. You know,
these are all differentiating

225
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,970
factors of cool features that
you can do with this app, that

226
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,340
that helps out. So these people
just like Dred Scott, you know,

227
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,500
there's always going to be
someone who raises their hand

228
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,080
and says, Yeah, I'll do some
chapters. And you know what, he

229
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,650
might burn out? They usually do.
And then there's five other

230
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,620
people who will jump in and
maybe he'll come back and you

231
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,840
know, that, that I'm not worried
about that at all. In fact, I

232
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,370
see it as a necessary part of
expanding what we're doing Is

233
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:04,380
this okay? Other media ecosystem
has this.

234
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:08,999
Well, that's the strength of.
It's interesting because that

235
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:12,299
that is the strength of
podcasting. And one of the

236
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:18,689
differentiators of podcasting
from other forms of media is the

237
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:25,289
direct engagement between the
podcast and the podcaster. And

238
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:28,139
the audience. Like there can
there's a level of engagement

239
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,289
there that just doesn't exist in
really any other form of media,

240
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:34,139
you see it a little bit when you
get like a little bit of a

241
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,729
popular was it morning Dr. Show,
in a certain in a certain

242
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:42,179
market, and you don't get a
tribe of people who are, you

243
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:44,879
know, like in trying to engage
with the show, but there's

244
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,849
really, there's not, there's a
limit, you can't do much. I

245
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:51,269
mean, because it's really audio
only. And there's, there's

246
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:54,929
limited avenues for interaction
to come back to the podcast or

247
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:58,589
from that, excuse me back to the
radio host from that tribe.

248
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:01,829
Well, in this regard, you have
it's interact, it's it's

249
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:03,419
internet native. So it's

250
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,690
built into it, it's built into
it. And you know, and the

251
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:11,040
simplest of simple things like
tapping on Periscope and sending

252
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:18,150
hearts, or, you know, likes or
super chats on YouTube, which

253
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,860
involves actual money. These are
all interactive features that

254
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,950
have a playback feature as well,
which is really cool. And one

255
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:34,020
thing I know is should be
possible, is regardless of of

256
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,200
how the value was flowing, if
we're talking about the

257
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:42,210
lightning, network payments,
case and payments, it can be

258
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:49,140
compiled into something for
everyone to use as, like a

259
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,580
timeline. So no matter where
it's coming from, I should be

260
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:58,320
able to tell if someone has
boosted of certain segments on

261
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,910
my show, from any random app.
And I should be able to say, oh,

262
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,110
someone like this right here.
Whether whether an app will will

263
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,690
play that back for me, such as
the Sphinx chat, where you can

264
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,570
go back and you can start the
podcast and you see exactly

265
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:18,210
where everyone boasted. I mean,
these are very valuable

266
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,700
interactions between the
audience and the and the

267
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,360
Creator.

268
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,710
What I would love to say, I
don't know if you saw the Mitch

269
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:31,710
Downey from pod verse had some
comments on mastodon and he was

270
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,040
talking about sound bites, when

271
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,980
that's my next that's my next
thing. I'm gonna hound people

272
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,110
for to create those sound bite.
Yeah,

273
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,110
yeah. And he was talking about,
Well, why don't we just pull

274
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,550
the two chapters in sound bites?
I saw that I was like, Oh, well,

275
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,000
that's fucking smart. Because
you should do it anyway, just by

276
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,610
ending, but in tag right or
length

277
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:57,390
behind just put your just take,
just take your your sound bites

278
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,810
out of you know, and he just
published your sound bites as a

279
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,480
chapters file. And then it's
just like, boom, boom, you know,

280
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,560
you can have as many as you
want.

281
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,710
But could you also, could you
also publish your chapters file

282
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,790
as a sound bites file?

283
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,430
Those no sound bites file? It's
just,

284
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,860
yeah, it's just URLs and time or
time codes and duration. Yeah.

285
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,790
Right. So, but I guess what I'm
asking is, will it be

286
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,750
interchangeable?

287
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,760
Should be Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if
he had if he had, because you

288
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,970
can have as many sound bites as
you want. So if you had,

289
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,820
because I would, the reason why
I asked because I wouldn't mind

290
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,640
as an option, being able to
toggle the image off on a

291
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,570
chapter after X amount of time,
or at a certain time code.

292
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,750
Because after a while, it's just
you know, if the next chapter

293
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,980
Mark isn't, until 45 minutes
later, and I'm still looking at,

294
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:57,630
you know, at a Gina haspel. Dead
or Alive. I mean, that gets a

295
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,630
little annoying, I would maybe
could switch back to the default

296
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,770
image after you could set a just
as long as you can set an out

297
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,880
time. That's kind of cool.

298
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,640
Yeah, there's an end time in the
change bag. Oh, there is well,

299
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,200
then we're done. It's, it's
optional. But it makes most of

300
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,150
these systems are gonna be
automated. So it should be

301
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,590
fairly quick to put it in there.
And then the apps just as

302
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,320
they're consuming, and, you
know, they just, they just go

303
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,020
out at that point. I've done
something to wake up hyper

304
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,420
capture on my phone when I
looked at it earlier, because

305
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,170
it's just, it's sending me note
push notifications of bookmarks.

306
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,510
Like, as they're added, I guess,

307
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,420
also just hyper catch. Oh,
that's cool. you're logged in.

308
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,150
So it's sending you the
notifications that someone did a

309
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:39,750
chapter.

310
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,570
Yeah, and I got it. I got a push
notification that said John's

311
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:50,220
cream, sex. Evidently the title
of one of the bookmarks, and so

312
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,070
of course, I had to click on
that. Like there's

313
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,710
Yeah, I'm getting wait. So like
you're getting notification

314
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,540
notifications of podcasts. you
subscribe to this. No one puts a

315
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,860
chapter marker in. Yeah. Holy
fuck. Excuse me. That's

316
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,960
fantastic. I didn't know it did
that.

317
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,400
Yeah, I've got like, Oh,

318
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,240
shit. So you get notification
from the community. They've

319
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:20,220
added a bookmark. Evidently. Oh,
man. This is what I'm talking

320
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,560
about. All right, we're our work
is done here.

321
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,930
Of course. not stopping.

322
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,030
Alright, so good to know because
I'm gonna, I'm gonna see how I

323
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,210
was as this soundbite is
implemented, right that.

324
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,610
Okay. So is implemented it like,
yes, it's implemented and is

325
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,070
being used. I'm looking at the
tables on the exact

326
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,150
same JSON.

327
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,280
No, no, no sound standbys,
purely an XML tag? There isn't

328
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,600
there's no JSON component to it
at all. So it exists, it exists

329
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:57,360
in the feed. Whereas the Trent
transcripts and chapters, but

330
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,570
the tag references an external
JSON file.

331
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:07,110
Okay, ah, okay, so how are those
two interchangeable, then? Well,

332
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,940
if you had an if you, you could
come? Well, it'd be

333
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,770
interchangeable Not, not within
the feed itself. But you can you

334
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,590
do the conversion, you know, you
go back and forth in software.

335
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,060
It Like, like, what Mitch is
doing is he's putting as he's

336
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,880
pulling in sound bites. And as
people are creating sound bites

337
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,300
in pod verse. He outputs them as
a chapters file as a JSON file.

338
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,640
Oh, okay. I

339
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,500
get it. I got it. Yeah. So you
just

340
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,620
because they're roughly
equivalent in their

341
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,980
specifications, even though
they're not really intended for

342
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,660
the same purpose, right.

343
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,330
But the time codes all match up
if you want to?

344
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,420
Yes, that's right. Yeah. And you
and instead of doing a start

345
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,670
cut, start time and a duration,
you should just start timing in

346
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,430
in time, which is easy, because
you just add the duration to the

347
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,130
start time and there's your
income. And

348
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:04,920
user. Okay, so the conversion.
So if I had that in, in the

349
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,260
freedom controller, I could
start adding that manually

350
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,060
myself. the click of a button.
Okay. Well, I have to talk to my

351
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:18,780
my roadie, yeah. Don't Don't
bother. He's tuning guitars.

352
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,500
Yes.

353
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,280
He's really busy. There's 6785,
transcripts and database

354
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:31,320
currently in there, or just
clicking through here and

355
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,410
looking at stats. There's 30,600
chapter files in the database.

356
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,710
Okay. That's a good metric.
That's a good metric to look at

357
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,340
over time.

358
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,520
5946 sound bites? Not bad.
That's not bad at all. I

359
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,870
really didn't. I see someone had
an idea to create a feed or

360
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,330
something out of just the sound
bites.

361
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,520
Yeah. That was really cool. I
like

362
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,400
that idea. Has anyone did that
wind up getting done? Is that Is

363
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,510
there an end point for that?

364
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,990
No, no, there's an input for the
soundbite. Yeah, you can, you

365
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,810
can subscribe to the sound bytes
endpoint. And it just every time

366
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,870
there's a new one that pops up
in the system. Cool. You get it?

367
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:14,370
Oh, cool. That would be a great
virtual virtual feed to

368
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,290
subscribe to subscribe to it.
Yeah.

369
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,180
Yeah. You can just leverage how
do we do this? Is it done yet?

370
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,410
Yes. Does it work yet? Dave?
Over there. Yeah.

371
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,860
I was on. Frederick dormans.
podcast.

372
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,100
Yes. I was going to ask you how
that went. This is great. Yeah.

373
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:40,080
Now you're. I just want to say
yeah, you're real podcaster. No,

374
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:44,490
go. Yeah. Oh, yes. Your mo Yeah.
And certainly for a dude named

375
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,170
Ben. Man. You talk well.

376
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:55,830
Well, that is the dead. And you
smell less than you straddled

377
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,730
that so good.

378
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,980
No, you really do. You're a
natural podcaster. And you look,

379
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,560
you're the guy who has the
donation set. You got the clips.

380
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,340
I'm just like, I'm your roadie
here. No showing up to the

381
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,180
party.

382
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,180
I saw one. I think I know what I
saw. One is I saw

383
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,020
one. Okay.

384
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,210
Thank you. Um, and it's so
annoying.

385
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,370
What did you say the beginning?

386
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,220
I keep saying, um, and it's so
annoying.

387
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,490
Oh, back up. And it's so
annoying.

388
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,690
I'm the king of that. It's just
a bridge.

389
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,760
I'm trying. I'm trying to do
better. I feel like I did better

390
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,650
on on Frederick's podcast it
was.

391
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:38,760
Tell me about Frederick's
podcast. That was great. Well,

392
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,160
it was it was the name of the
but it's not called Frederick's

393
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,050
podcast is it and

394
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:48,240
it is not called fresh cast. In.
embarrassingly, I

395
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,700
don't know what the title is.
But I can for purposes of this

396
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,070
show, it'll be known as
Frederick's podcast

397
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,660
is Frederick's podcast. I have

398
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,760
to put a link in the show notes.
So we'll look that up.

399
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:05,070
What I don't know this time. Got
it. Yeah, now I can't be Fred

400
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:10,590
draping it. Yeah, he's literally
looking at Frederick

401
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,120
flippin Frederick.

402
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,990
If only there was a place on the
internet, you could go to look

403
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,430
up podcasts.

404
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,530
Let me see. This is sad. Dave
Jones.

405
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:27,900
Okay, all right. I've got it I'm
now I'm redeeming myself because

406
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:35,100
this what we have in the index
is a thing called doormen calm

407
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,560
podcasts. That's the title of
it.

408
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:38,640
Really.

409
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:46,110
But that can't be right because
there's no episodes is Borman DJ

410
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:54,270
o r e. m A in Frederick. I'm
saying Bjorkman. Right that. And

411
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,710
I think that's the right
pronounce this

412
00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:00,390
one episode from 2013. Yeah, but
that can't be right. can't be

413
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:00,720
right.

414
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:07,320
Oh, here it is. Okay, I got it.
It's called cut snack. That's my

415
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,690
Swedish. Cut. Yeah. Okay.

416
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,920
And how do you spell that?

417
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:14,489
KOD is in a ck.

418
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,740
cod snack. cod snack. This is
Swedish.

419
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,320
Is that hey, is that your cod
snack

420
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,160
and English?

421
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:27,149
Yeah, also the letter? Yes.
Okay. Dino Swedish.

422
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,790
I just said that the only thing
I know he else could

423
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,770
use a cousin Agnes.

424
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:35,399
caught that new two. I know two
things in Swedish now yellow sky

425
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:38,939
and cod snack and cousin egg. So
you're not on it. This is not on

426
00:26:38,969 --> 00:26:40,109
yet. cod snack.

427
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,479
Now. He said it would drop on
1215

428
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:47,759
No, no, it's gonna drop a nice
Oh, yes. Drop it like is hot.

429
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:51,479
What is this show about a
podcast by developers about

430
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:54,029
anything interesting to
developers. So let me guess.

431
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,149
Yeah, you talks about
developing. These are real

432
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:57,959
developers.

433
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,000
Okay, these are fake. These are
not

434
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,030
like the phoneys over podcast
indie. Yeah.

435
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,020
These aren't it guys. They
pretend to be. These are like

436
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,410
real ones. Oh, whoo. Okay. I was
out of my league.

437
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,500
I was gonna say you, you're
marrying up now. I see very

438
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:13,830
nice.

439
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,560
posnick like a punching above my
weight.

440
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,670
Yeah, that's it.

441
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,380
But it was a great talk. And it
was just me is is me and him.

442
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,640
And we were all over the map. I
mean, like, wait, yeah, we

443
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,550
talked about, you know,
obviously programming stuff and

444
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:33,750
index and all that stuff. But we
got into COVID. And the

445
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,530
difference between the mind and
the brain and Oh, my. Yeah.

446
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,810
Well, we were all over the map.
It was great. He's He's really

447
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,590
easy to talk to Craig.

448
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,130
It's nice. So weird.

449
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:50,910
Well, he's the developer of the
Mac chapters app.

450
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,520
Ah, right. Right. Right. Right.

451
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:58,170
Yeah. And we found each other,
reached out to him and got him

452
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,540
involved into into the
namespace. And we were able to

453
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,390
merge our chapter formats
together and right. I remember

454
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,860
beautiful, happy experience. And
it was great. Yes.

455
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,590
And they ever had a fight.

456
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:18,330
Yeah, not yet. Beautiful. But
but that gets that gets me Do we

457
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,630
get we get any more namespace?
Well, we get namespace stuff. We

458
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,050
don't talk about a Yes, I know.
This is the exciting part of the

459
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:25,470
show.

460
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,750
Yes, the pace. pays the day.
Hello.

461
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,410
Hello, ladies. Welcome to the
namespace corner with Adam and

462
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,220
Dave and we're gonna talk dirty
namespace to you

463
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:42,030
to female donors. Oh, over the
last 14 weeks. And we know for a

464
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:47,190
fact it's namespace abroad. No
doubt about it. Oh, man lady.

465
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,150
just heard them cancel their
subscriptions. Okay. Yes.

466
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,190
Well, yeah, any other nice day
like I because I've got the only

467
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,360
thing I've got on mine. Well,

468
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:01,080
people is still a thing. I mean,
this seems like a lingering

469
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,780
thing that hangs out there. And
then we get some energy and we

470
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,170
yap about it. And then it kind
of goes away. Where's people

471
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,880
because people is in trouble.

472
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,570
If people is in less trouble
than location.

473
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,830
Look, is last What can I say?

474
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,690
is off the radar? Nobody can
find it. People. I feel good.

475
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,570
Real good about people. I had a
phone call. Oh, God, When was

476
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:35,850
this? Well, we did. We talked
with it. Then. From the father

477
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:41,850
five or farside. Dan Benjamin.
Dan Benjamin last week. So it

478
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,700
was actually last week that I
had a call from the pot with the

479
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,870
pod chaser guys.

480
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,240
pod chaser.

481
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:52,620
Yeah, pod chaser. And if you
look, if you look at pod chaser,

482
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:59,430
they have a database. I think I
posted it the other day. In the

483
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:05,880
mastodons. Have a database of
appearances. Oh, yeah, shows.

484
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,270
Right. Right. Right. Right.
Right. Right. Okay. So this is

485
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:12,180
an external service and we're
trying to integrate with them or

486
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,110
be compatible.

487
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,900
Well, yeah, we're trying to make
sure that we're compatible

488
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,740
because I mean, if you think
about it, you got IMDb in places

489
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,250
like that.

490
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,980
You're This is this makes sense.
This is definitely the I didn't

491
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,770
even realize this is exactly
what I did. This is great. Okay,

492
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,910
yeah. Tell me what we're doing.

493
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:31,199
Yeah. So if you see, honestly
search for Adam Curry, there's

494
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:35,819
Adam Curry that guy, and it
lists all the pod fodder.

495
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:41,730
Let's see if it's any good. pod
father. And guess what? fail?

496
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,790
fail? Well, they clearly they
suck.

497
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:45,899
Obviously.

498
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,820
If you look at if you look at
Adam Curry there, there's you. I

499
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,890
mean, it shows all your
appearances. You see that?

500
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,240
I'm looking at him now. Let's
see. Oh, yeah. I appeared on no

501
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,380
agenda buzz cast Joe Rogan two
episodes. Very good. New Media

502
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,270
show one episode. I think I've
done two.

503
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,300
It's got you been on Adam
Carolla.

504
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,010
Yes, long, long time ago.

505
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:14,310
And on Austin sessions for 2013
possible Yeah.

506
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,860
Yes, no, of course, I know
exactly. When that was. I've

507
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,870
been on more since then. But
okay. Yeah, the people aren't

508
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,670
using the people, tech people
are people.

509
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:30,120
So this, like, what what this
would be is a, what we're going

510
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:37,530
to recommend in the namespace
tag for person is a URL link to

511
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,740
that, right there where so. So
if you have a person needs to

512
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,860
Adam Curry, and you also have a
URL, this is pod chaser.com,

513
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,300
slash creator slash Adam Curry,
blah, blah, blah. Okay. It's a

514
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,860
canonical sort of canonical
reference to insist there may be

515
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,450
more than one Adam Curry. This
is the differentiator, to say

516
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:01,350
I'm now I'm talking about this
Adam Curry. And then they can

517
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:04,500
vary. And then you also have the
built in verification that

518
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,560
they're doing on their back end,
which is sort of their bit, you

519
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,710
know, their whole business is to
do this type of stuff, where

520
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,280
they do verification, that
people when people say they've

521
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,560
been on a podcast that they
actually were on that episode,

522
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,680
okay? And alternatively, what
can you link to from the people

523
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,240
tag, you can link to anything
you want? It's really just comes

524
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,470
down to a matter of wording.

525
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:30,720
So if you had, what we're what
we're going to recommend is that

526
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,510
people link to the pod
chaser.com profile for the user

527
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,350
for the person there in
question. And then as fall

528
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,610
backs, you could link to
Wikipedia, their blog, you know,

529
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:46,800
a project, you could link to
anything as a fallback, just to

530
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,850
have something. But But if you
have the pod chaser Comm.

531
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,930
reference, it would be
considered, you know, better,

532
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,250
more authoritative because you
have their whole work behind it.

533
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,200
Right. And they're working with
good, they're working with

534
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,900
companies to provide this
service to ensure Sure.

535
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:09,360
Interesting, okay, so that's
just a people tag, and then

536
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:14,880
infinite number of names and
URLs. Yeah. And spelling and how

537
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,360
is that handled? If it's Adam
see curry Adam Clark curry.

538
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:24,690
As long as your link is cleared
to the purchase contract to the

539
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,800
Creator, then you can

540
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:31,530
report this. I support this 100%
actually 99% if pod chaser will

541
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:36,030
link my profile to pod father,
then I'm 100. I don't want to

542
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:39,120
spike anything. But how cool
would that be? I wouldn't pay

543
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,460
for like a like a custom domain
name.

544
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,590
So the vanity, your vanity?
Yeah.

545
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,620
vanity profile? Hell yeah.
Excuse me. Isn't that exactly

546
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,960
the same thing? vanity profile?
Well,

547
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:53,790
maybe it is. Yeah, that's
exactly right. pod, pod father

548
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,870
in there. And as long as it
links to

549
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:58,740
Adam Curry your goal? Cool. Very
good, sir. And this is nice.

550
00:33:59,280 --> 00:33:59,760
Yes, I

551
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,690
think and there's also an extra
piece. There's optional stuff in

552
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:07,740
there, as well. And I think what
we settled on is the name,

553
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:12,090
clearly, link, whatever that
happens to be. And then you're

554
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:19,680
going to have a role and a type,
excuse me a role and a group.

555
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:24,300
And so the role would be like,
guest hosts, you know, co host,

556
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:30,240
producer blah, blah, blah. And
then the group is just very

557
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,450
optional, if that's even a thing
can add on if things can be very

558
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:37,020
optional, but group is as long
as

559
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:40,109
were we satisfying with this
group nonsense that you can't

560
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:40,589
explain.

561
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:49,080
satisfying the honest potential.
No, no, no, no, no, it's not

562
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:55,770
bad. The potential for people to
get very specific with who they

563
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,790
credit on their podcast. Yeah,
and I would think there are

564
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:03,000
probably Probably some people
out there, they want to get very

565
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,110
specific I do.

566
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,050
Yeah, I'm one of them. So I'm
very interested in wanted, they

567
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,170
want to think so I could say
executive producers as a group

568
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,410
and associate executive
producers as a group. And could

569
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:18,000
I also say, end of mixes as a
group, and your show mixes?

570
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:24,210
These the groups listed are the
official groups within the pod

571
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:28,290
cast taxonomy project. And
that's what we talked about

572
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,280
once. Yes. Okay. And this is
only a White House or something.

573
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,850
It is, yeah. And we're in it's
being finalized. Right, now that

574
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,700
I've got a preliminary list. So
that's why the group thing is

575
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,390
very optional, because like, the
way they listed out as they say,

576
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:47,610
you know, they give like a
group, producers. And then

577
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,670
there's, there's various sub
titles within producer and then

578
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,480
they may say, audio engineer, or
engineering, and then there's

579
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,340
various ones in there, and blah,
blah, blah, blah. So they're

580
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,710
these little groups. If you just
leave the group thing out all

581
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:02,430
together, in that, then it
assumes you're talking about

582
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,630
caste, which would give you host
ghost blah, blah, blah, almost

583
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,810
all the 19 Yeah, which is what
99% of people are going to use.

584
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,230
But then if you wanted to get
more specific, you could put the

585
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:19,170
group in there, and then say,
okay, audio engineer, a lighting

586
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,970
guy that, you know, that kind of
stuff.

587
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:24,360
There's no link to the podcast,
taxonomy project.

588
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,860
They have not officially
finalized. Okay, list. Yes, I

589
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,030
didn't link to it. Okay. We can
roll. We can roll it out without

590
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:37,200
that since the group. But I
think I don't think it's sacred.

591
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,860
I think they'll let us publish
it. And I don't, when I talked

592
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,990
to them the other day, they said
this is basically just

593
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:50,940
I have to see it to know if I
like it. Is that weird? No, not

594
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,000
at all. I could afford it. I'll
send you a code that mean

595
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,550
because I'm just looking at it
should be linked to the

596
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,780
namespace docs.

597
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:02,579
Yes. I just first whatever.
Yeah. And get that funny. They

598
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:07,139
I'm having some back and forth
with Ben slinger from pod chaser

599
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:08,519
and their bins slinger.

600
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,500
Yes. Great name.

601
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,610
Yeah. And meet his brother gun.

602
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,720
Sounds like a DJ. In a soft,

603
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:24,240
everybody been slinging around
the big w h Cz 100. That is a

604
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,390
great, great DJ name. I just
tested the ticket for a ride,

605
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,460
etc. etc.

606
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,090
Alright, so I get it this I
think this is very clear. Now we

607
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,690
just have to, you know, I think
we just need to know the, the

608
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:40,740
actual roles and groups, I'm
sure they've got it down. Yeah,

609
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:45,270
taxonomy means they took it
apart. So they understand. And

610
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:49,350
then the the last bastard child
of locate location.

611
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:55,170
Yeah, location is completely off
the rails. And it, we're, we're

612
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,920
gonna rewrite this thing. It's
funny, all the pieces are there,

613
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,120
it's just that trying to get
location, the really hard thing

614
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,820
is trying to get the
specification of how you want it

615
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,060
documented. You know, and I
mean, there's like 10 different

616
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,240
ways you can give a location.
Well, and so everybody's got

617
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,780
their everybody's got their
preference, and we're gonna

618
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,960
settle on something. I mean,
that you know what it does?

619
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,390
Ah,

620
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:27,120
let me think about this for a
second. Because I think what

621
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,980
appears to me the issue at the
core, besides How do you

622
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,090
document it, how do you write it
down? Is everybody has a

623
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:41,940
preferred way of location? Hmm.
And, you know, so I like the

624
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:46,620
Maidenhead locator, of course,
which is, you know, amateur

625
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:51,030
radio, satellite type. So I
think satellite people use it

626
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:56,040
too. Okay, because it's
footprint, I think. But then we

627
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:03,360
have GPS, you know, GNS s type
stuff. We have zip code country

628
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,300
codes. So there's all these
different ways latitude,

629
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,590
longitude, Latin long. It's
like, so what we don't really

630
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:16,170
have is a good example of a use
case, I would posit that that

631
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,490
drives that decision.

632
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:23,460
I think the problem is there's
two use cases, they compete with

633
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:29,370
one another. And they both have
total validity, like so. The

634
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:33,510
first use case would be a
podcast player that wants to

635
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:38,280
show you the location. And for
that, for the podcast, what

636
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,810
would be best for the podcast
app is if it's just a name, like

637
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:49,050
Stockholm, you know, or
Brussels. That would be the

638
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,750
simplest because I use rip it
out of the tag and put it right

639
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,560
into the to the to the user
interface. You don't have to do

640
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,900
any API lookups or any of that
kind of job. But then you have

641
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,510
this other use case. You're
talking about. gaiters and

642
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:04,770
indexes in directories where
they want to assemble a lot,

643
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,370
they want to start to do more
complex data where they figure

644
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:14,280
out who's in a region and help,
you know, interest in discovery

645
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,410
and all this kind of jazz. And
that's also a valid use case.

646
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:20,160
But for that flatline, maybe
better OpenStreetMap IDs may be

647
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,660
better, or blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah. So it seems like

648
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,110
there's two perfectly valid use
cases. One is simple ones

649
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:31,590
complex, and you want to be able
to support both in a single tag.

650
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,550
So dot dot, dot.

651
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:43,260
Yeah, I see the issue. But what
you didn't really give me is, is

652
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:47,400
a real use case example. I
understand. You know, why? Why

653
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,720
do you want just? What was your
example Brussels or whatever?

654
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,500
Why, why do you want that? What
is that? What is the point? What

655
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,790
are we using this for?

656
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:05,910
To find a local podcast for
Association? So and here's the

657
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:10,650
other issue is does the location
refer to where the podcast where

658
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,670
the podcast is recorded? Or what
is referred to what the podcast

659
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:18,240
is about? And I think 90% of the
time, it's going to be what it's

660
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,630
about. I mean, because nobody
cares where the podcast coming

661
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:25,200
from necessarily. I mean, I'm
here in Birmingham, Alabama,

662
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,610
but, I mean, that's not where
the podcast has nothing to do

663
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:33,420
with Birmingham, Alabama. And
the podcast is about every

664
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:37,980
summer melt. So I don't even
know what to put in podcasting.

665
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:43,320
2.0 as far as the location tag,
do we put Boston Birmingham?

666
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,890
Let's see, there's this other
class of or maybe we don't put a

667
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,270
location tag, there's other

668
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,430
classes. Go ahead. No, please
continue.

669
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,430
There's this other class of
podcasts where it's very

670
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:58,080
applicable. I mean, like, it's,
it's extremely important, you

671
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,430
know, relevant to the nature of
that show as to whether, where,

672
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:05,640
you know, like a location
specification. So, you know, I

673
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,520
don't know, what would you put
down? What would you put down

674
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,390
for no agenda?

675
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:17,400
Get mo nation? That's my
location. If you're looking from

676
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,790
podcasts, for podcasts from
Gizmo, nation, that's my

677
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:23,970
location. That's what I would
put in the feed. No joke.

678
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:28,710
Okay, well, okay, that that's,
that's great. That's, that's

679
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:33,360
important information, because
that means that that name, that

680
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:39,870
name tag, is, like it's
critical. Like just just a

681
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:47,310
straight string location. Is is
important. And the other stuff

682
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,150
is less so.

683
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:57,810
Well, all right, let me approach
this from an odd podcaster.

684
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:03,750
standpoint. Go, if I had any, I
agree with you that the only

685
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:08,250
reason for me to put a location
into my feed would be for search

686
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:15,990
purposes of people looking for a
particular podcast that either

687
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:21,960
was from or about a particular
place. And in my mind, that can

688
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,580
be fictional or nonfiction. And
I would say get mo nation. And I

689
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,820
would expect there to be many
other podcasts would be almost

690
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:36,210
like a tag. But why not say
moonbase? alpha is just as

691
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,910
valid. And we do want to build
for the future, actually.

692
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,210
So what's the last line of
moonbase? alpha?

693
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:45,720
You can't get that. It's not
important. I mean, hey, you ever

694
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:51,420
hear of Google Maps? bitch? Look
it up? That's my point. I think

695
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,140
we fixed it.

696
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,870
Yes. Okay. It's done. All right.
Next step.

697
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,820
So again, but it should I think
it should be. Yes, I understand

698
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,450
the documentation problem. I
totally get it. So maybe

699
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:07,980
approach it from the reverse and
say, This is a code that can be

700
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:18,750
used in search for a in a
geographic search. of podcasts.

701
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,150
It would be more podcast
content. Maybe that's maybe

702
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:28,080
that's your out instead of
podcast creation, say, you know,

703
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,170
based upon just like people, I
think you have to handle just

704
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:36,930
like people. You know, just like
a person is in this a place is

705
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:40,500
in this and that can be the
place that is made or the place

706
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,260
that it's about. Hmm.

707
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,220
And,

708
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,890
you know, that next level of
granularity? I don't know, I

709
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,950
think you have to know the
person has to do something

710
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,800
themselves at some point because
they have better AI than we can

711
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,910
build. Is this really about
Stockholm? Or is it from

712
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:01,110
Stockholm? Or is it both? But I
think I think you approach it

713
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:04,440
from it's it's a search code.
It's something that will be

714
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:10,440
searched. Prop likely, yeah, a
search. And when instead of

715
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,100
here's what you use it for, you
know, you get this information

716
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,800
and here's what you get. And
then you can do all kinds of

717
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,800
stuff with it. If you know stop
calm, you can get the lat long,

718
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,080
you can get the Maidenhead, you
can do all that stuff, you can

719
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,220
get the nearest airplane,
navigation beacon. Um, you can

720
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,180
do a million things.

721
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:33,359
At some of the the location tag
is suffering from from, from

722
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,229
Tech overthink? Yes, exactly.
Which is always going to be the

723
00:45:37,229 --> 00:45:41,519
case. And some of it is is truly
kind of tricky to figure out.

724
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,689
But I think I'm falling down on
this on the scale. I think I'm

725
00:45:45,689 --> 00:45:55,529
falling on the side of making it
more flexible. So he says, Sure.

726
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:59,819
It's always the right answer to
make to make your requirements

727
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:04,679
very, very small. And to make
everything else as optional as

728
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:05,159
possible.

729
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,310
Right. So that is, that's why
you have country locality lat

730
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:13,590
long and OS mid OSS, mid
OpenStreetMap. Id. So I could

731
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:16,890
choose what I want to put in
there. If I can, if I say okay,

732
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:20,610
just want to put in country.
Yeah, then I would use the

733
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,850
country code. Us I guess.

734
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,210
Yeah, that's right. Or gn forget
monition

735
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:35,490
gs sheet. Well, so here we go.
You've just no locality, human

736
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:39,450
readable place name is preferred
by the cod podcast publisher, or

737
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:42,810
display in an app valid values
are House of Parliament or North

738
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:47,790
Michigan. So yeah, so Stockholm
would be valid. And I could do I

739
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:50,580
guess, what is Sweden? s?

740
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:52,950
Oh, shoot.

741
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:58,290
se. I think it's se i think it's
se thing. Yours. That's

742
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:00,600
right. Yes. The se. Now you know
that this se

743
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:08,430
things I learned today? Okay, so
I could easily TLD Yeah, I could

744
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:12,870
use the country ISO 3166, one
alpha two country code. And I

745
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:16,920
could use the locality by saying
Stockholm and I could forego the

746
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,480
lat long and the awesome ID.
Yeah, it's fine. publish it.

747
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:25,110
Yes. I think that's fake,
because there's a recommendation

748
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,700
for having a type. And there are
Wait,

749
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:29,940
wait, wait, wait, this element
must contain at minimum a

750
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,960
country code na, when it goes my
get mo nation?

751
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:39,900
Well, I mean, you can have see
that that's where the type comes

752
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,250
in. So you get it's always you
always have a name. And the name

753
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:48,480
can be anything but then you can
also like, this is where we're

754
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,350
gonna have to rewrite it because
the the issue the comments that

755
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:54,990
we've been getting that we've
been plowing into that thing,

756
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,730
that the what you're seeing in
the spec doesn't match what the

757
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,520
current thinking in the comments
is. So the current thinking in

758
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,280
the comments is you have a type
identifier, where you say, okay,

759
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,280
you have a name, and that name
could be Stockholm, then you

760
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,900
have a type. And the type
specifies what location

761
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,470
information you're going to give
it. So this the type is country

762
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:20,220
code, then you give a country
code, and if the type is OSM ID,

763
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,490
then you give an OpenStreetMap,
Id type is this other, you know,

764
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:26,940
lat lon, and you get a latitude
longitude. So you can you can

765
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,690
leave all that out and just say,
oh, here's a name. Mm hmm. But

766
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:34,230
you can also put in type equals
whatever. And then you're

767
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:38,280
expected to give to give it what
you what you declared in the

768
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,210
time. You got it? That seems
fine to me. And, I mean, I think

769
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:46,860
that's where we're gonna end up
as a starting point. And I mean,

770
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,560
I don't see any other way to do
it. Honestly.

771
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:55,770
Yeah. Do you think that Who else
has a Who else has a dog in the

772
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:56,130
hunt?

773
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:02,460
As is five or six people in the
in the comment threads? So yeah,

774
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,190
and they're and none of them are
bad suggestions. They really

775
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:09,120
not. They're, they're all trying
to account for various things.

776
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:12,210
But I guess what I don't want to
end up with is just something

777
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:16,230
that's used pure. I don't want
to put a tag in there. It's only

778
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,720
going to be useful for metrics.

779
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:23,340
Right? Yeah, exactly. I agree. I
agree wholeheartedly.

780
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:28,110
Because who cares if somebody I
mean, ultimately, who cares if

781
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:31,770
there's some database somewhere
where a guy is enjoying looking

782
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:35,220
up? How many podcasts are in a
certain region? Because what you

783
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,860
really want to know if it's
useful for discoverability?

784
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:42,990
Let's do it was useful for user
happiness.

785
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:47,730
Yes, yes. Do it. Exactly.
Exactly. No,

786
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:50,400
but But no, I don't care about
database nerds. I just want to

787
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,470
know stuff. So anyway, that's my
thinking. But we're, we're

788
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:56,040
getting there.

789
00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:02,280
Yes, yes. Ladies and gentlemen.
Oops. I was gonna play some porn

790
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:07,080
music and say this concludes our
our namespace segment. It wasn't

791
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,130
the right porn music

792
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:10,620
coming into the fancy namespace

793
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,660
I had this way, maybe this was
it. This is what I wanted to

794
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:18,570
play. I'm gonna get ahead,
dammit.

795
00:50:19,169 --> 00:50:20,249
Yeah, you mess it up.

796
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,190
Yeah, no, I had that one all
queued up. But it was the it was

797
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:27,000
YouTube, man, those guys are so
out of inventory. They got to

798
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,780
put 15 ads in front of Ron
Jeremy. There we go. You're

799
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:38,520
sued by everybody in the course.
That is

800
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:46,230
namespace talk with Adam.
Casting 2.0. It's bigger than

801
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:48,210
ever before. Maybe.

802
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:56,490
Yeah, it can just jump into
shipment. And, yeah, so I mean,

803
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:59,610
I think we're getting okay to
wrap up namespace. I think we're

804
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:03,000
going I'm going to, I'm looking
at like at the end of January

805
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,920
like January 31. To close phase
two. But I mean, that's totally

806
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,960
flexible. I just want to get
through the holidays.

807
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:15,300
Yeah, we need extra time. Yeah.
Well, I'm excited. And value

808
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,170
will be in there.

809
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,500
As long as there's a lot of
discussion going on with value.

810
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:28,650
Yes, I've seen Brian of London.
He's doing a valiant effort to

811
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:36,210
get hive developers into using
the value block for their chain.

812
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:37,110
Yeah.

813
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,180
And web, the web monetization,

814
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:43,680
the web. monetization is an
interesting one. I let me tell

815
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,360
you about this. Because

816
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,830
I don't get any research on it.
Because I did a

817
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:49,080
little guy sent me an email,
someone reached out to me from

818
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:53,820
the web monetization project,
someone who works there. And,

819
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:59,340
and said, Hey, you know, we've
heard your podcast. It felt a

820
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:03,480
little for me to me. But I could
be wrong. It felt a little bit

821
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,480
of No, and the guy's high enough
from the I just haven't. I'm

822
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,240
glad we brought this up, because
I haven't replied to him yet. So

823
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,780
I said, so he said, I hear
Whitney, I heard the podcast I'm

824
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,980
listened to with a link I about
your project, but link to

825
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:22,260
podcast index. org, which to me
felt a little form form ish. And

826
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:26,130
he said, You know, this is this
is what we're doing. We're

827
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:30,780
creating a web monetization
standard. And this is the

828
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:35,190
company I forget the company
name coil coil. Thank you. And

829
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:41,010
you go look at coil and it. What
it seems to be is a couple of

830
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:47,700
one or more Silicon Valley,
people who made money, maybe in

831
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,340
PayPal, I'm not sure or they
were in

832
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:51,480
ripple.

833
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:56,880
There we go. See how good my
story is. Thank you ripple. So

834
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,250
that and it may be an offshoot
of ripple, I'm not quite sure

835
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,940
how connected those two are. And
they have a grant and the grant

836
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:08,370
is 100 million dollars. And to
be honest, my first impression

837
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:13,200
was Oh, okay, they want to
create a standard, the money, I

838
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,170
think the conversion runs
through them, or they have some

839
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:19,770
part of the fee to whatever web
monetization is, that wasn't

840
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:25,620
really clear from the consumer
marketing side. And they're, in

841
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:29,220
essence giving out hundred
thousand dollar grants to small

842
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:33,480
companies who either have
websites with content or content

843
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,170
creators, as long as they adopt
the standard, which is a

844
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:42,330
JavaScript meant to send
payments, micro payments in real

845
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:46,110
time to the creators through
this through this system. Do I

846
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,160
have that kind of right?

847
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,110
It's what it seems like to me.
Yeah.

848
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:52,500
So the part I don't like, is the
grant part.

849
00:53:54,930 --> 00:54:05,580
Yeah. Yeah, it's this. I watched
three videos of Stephan Thomas,

850
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:09,480
I think is his name. He's the
CEO of coil. What three videos

851
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:15,750
of him explaining how
interledger works, which is

852
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:19,650
evidently the backbone of the
way the web monetization thing

853
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:20,130
work. Is

854
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:23,670
it is it quote, unquote, just
another blockchain? Or is it

855
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:24,690
something else?

856
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:29,910
It's different. And honestly, I
can't. I still don't know. I

857
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:35,190
still can't grasp entirely
what's happening there. I gave

858
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,980
it a valiant effort. And I'm
still not real sure. But you

859
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,620
know, the, the thing, the thing
that gives me pause about it

860
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:47,730
like, is that he, he's, he used
to be the CTO at ripple. And it

861
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:53,700
seems very tied to XRP. Mm hmm.
And I'm just not like i'm not

862
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,340
i'm not saying I'm not saying
it's a scam or anything. I don't

863
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,880
I don't think that that's the
case at all, but but I'm not

864
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,920
doing I guess what concerns me
is that it seems this web

865
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:09,180
monetization, quote unquote,
standard seems very tied to coil

866
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:09,990
the company.

867
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:14,190
Yes, that's what that's what I
introduced as well as like, all

868
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,920
the conversion goes through
them, and then everybody can use

869
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,960
it. But it Yeah, and I'm sure
that I'm sure this is some chain

870
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,990
and ledger that's open that
anyone can look at. I'm sure.

871
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:32,340
It's just adopting a standard.
And I've been a part of, well,

872
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:36,900
one, really, and you know, we're
doing some some additional work

873
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:42,810
on it on a standard now. But if
you drive it through incentives

874
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:46,770
of cash, to me, that's no
different than I'll pay you 1500

875
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:52,440
bucks to take the COVID vaccine,
you know, it's like, yeah, now,

876
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,980
it's like, people gotta want
this, they gotta want to do it.

877
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,840
And, and see, I mean, I'm sure
people see the benefit, but once

878
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:05,880
you're tied to any organization
with a grant, and grant is, you

879
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,030
know, it's not like, Here's your
money, enjoy. There's always

880
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:13,020
stuff tied to it one way or the
other. You have a master and,

881
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:19,320
you know, and with Bitcoin, no
Master, certainly, there's no

882
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,450
grants. I mean, I'm sure there's
grants, but you know, what I

883
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:26,490
mean? is like, write grants
shouldn't be tied to the, to

884
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:29,010
what your to the, to the
protocol, or whatever it is,

885
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,650
they're they're doing, I mean,
just who's driving that? Who

886
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:35,400
was, uh, who showed up and start
talking about you remember?

887
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:40,830
I think it was been forecast
upon, because we

888
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:44,790
may be way off base. We may. And
I and I don't, I'm just giving

889
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,530
you my impression, I think
you're doing the same.

890
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:49,860
Totally. And I'm totally just
speaking from first impressions.

891
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:54,360
And, and I could be completely
wrong about all of this. But I'm

892
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,120
having such a difficult time
understanding how it worked and

893
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:01,890
how it exists outside of the
outside of coil the company

894
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:07,860
that, I mean, based on what they
said in their presentations. It,

895
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,360
it should, like there should be
multiple people involved, other

896
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,750
companies can get involved in
it. But I'm not sure. Like, at

897
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:18,420
some point, you're going, you're
going fee, you're doing

898
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:21,750
conversions here. And so
somebody's got to pay fees

899
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:25,740
somewhere. And the only way I
can imagine that this works when

900
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,250
you're going from when you're
doing these micro transactions

901
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:33,780
across a ledger and then doing a
conversion back into Fiat is

902
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:37,800
that these things get batched
together in some way. And then

903
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,590
there's a convert, there's a
large batch conversion process

904
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:44,550
that happens, so that you get
the fee as low as possible. And

905
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:48,030
then there's an arbitrage
somewhere for the for the

906
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:54,300
company that's doing it to make
a profit. And, like, so. So this

907
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:58,770
sounds extremely difficult to
set up. I mean, and I don't

908
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,110
know, I guess it just strikes me
as one of those quote unquote,

909
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:05,610
standards that they kind of did
just kind of always limps along

910
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:08,730
and never gets beyond one
company. Hmm, yeah. Because I

911
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:11,460
think it's been around for a
couple years now. And I'm not

912
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:16,110
sure that it's like, Okay, well,
if coil folds, then the standard

913
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:20,160
folds, right? I don't know. And
let's just write the whole thing

914
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,290
sounds a little strange to me,
maybe somebody else can clear it

915
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,730
up? Well, um,

916
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,500
you know, really, with the,
since I dove into lightning, and

917
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:31,560
of course, I've been ramping up
to this for a couple of years

918
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,970
with my conversion to to really
be, you know, seeing the value

919
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:43,140
in Bitcoin, just by itself. And
as I dig deeper into the

920
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:48,270
material, I see that Bitcoin
still is the mama you know,

921
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:51,390
it's, it's, it's the Big Mama of
the whole kit and caboodle.

922
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:55,650
Everyone converts out of
Bitcoin, essentially, into the

923
00:58:55,650 --> 00:59:02,520
secondary coins. But really,
we're just now and I think, and

924
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,430
this is just my view, and you
know, if you don't agree, fine,

925
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:08,670
you don't need to call me out.
Because I don't know what I'm

926
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,080
talking. Yes, you do. Yeah. You

927
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:10,560
must call.

928
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,810
Yeah, call me up. Because I
don't know what I'm talking

929
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:16,620
about. But my view is that we
needed this secondary layer,

930
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:20,730
which I see is lightning.
Because lightning is Bitcoin.

931
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:24,090
And it makes so much sense. So
we can, you know, write do all

932
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:28,530
these faster transactions, real
time transactions, write funky

933
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:35,070
contracts that can be handled at
execution layer. You know,

934
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,330
instead of doing it with yet
another blockchain with with,

935
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,330
you know, a conversion to XRP I
think everyone's trying to

936
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,040
incorrectly I think solve the
problem of all well, how are we

937
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,490
going to, you know, get people
to understand, you put your

938
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:53,880
credit card in here and then
you've got Bitcoin there. And to

939
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:58,530
me, I look at this from a
different perspective. Now, I

940
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:01,560
don't need the company to hold
my hand You know, with with some

941
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:04,890
web monetization that looks
official, I don't, I don't need

942
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:09,990
any of that. What I need is a
reason for Bitcoin to be fun to

943
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:15,510
me. So, if I go and get a
podcast app, it has a wallet in

944
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:19,260
there. Okay, well now I
understand at least when I'm

945
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:23,520
doing okay, I need to get some
kind of money into this. So I

946
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,870
can send money through this app
to podcasters. And I can boost

947
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:32,250
stuff and do other things. I
think podcasting will make

948
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:37,230
learning Bitcoin fun. For a lot
of people give them something to

949
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:40,470
do instead of changing money and
trying to figure out how did I

950
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,170
lose what what feels good to get
taken, you know, this is the

951
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:44,580
stuff that hangs people up,

952
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:48,660
because that's all you're doing.
We're not we underestimate the

953
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,540
excuse me, we overestimate the
onboarding problem, I think a

954
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,030
lot of times, because that's
where everybody gets hung up.

955
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:56,970
And Bitcoin is the onboarding
problem. But I mean, if you go

956
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:59,340
back, okay, think about 10 years
ago. Did you ever think that

957
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:02,220
your grandma will be downloading
chrome and installing it on a

958
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,060
Windows computer? Oh,

959
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:06,900
exactly. These things do take
time. They do take time. Yeah,

960
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:10,500
absolutely. I Yeah, of course.
Your grandma struggled more with

961
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,580
Web TV. If you remember that.
Crap. Oh, yeah. With the remote

962
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,140
control trying to try

963
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:19,590
to hit letters. That was
Microsoft when that Microsoft? I

964
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:19,770
think

965
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:22,080
they bought it. They bought
them. They bought them. I think

966
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,330
I think Chris Jacob was involved
in that deal.

967
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:27,120
Oh, that is a that's your buddy.

968
01:01:27,149 --> 01:01:29,669
Yeah, yeah, I think okay, sir.
Chris, I think he was involved

969
01:01:29,669 --> 01:01:30,089
in that.

970
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:33,600
Because that was all like their
big push was that it has MSN

971
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,790
network. You know, you can get
to

972
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:39,360
see how you can just look
towards history and see that

973
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,270
none of this is permanent. And
I'm looking at you Spotify.

974
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:46,710
Yeah, no, no. You want to hear
it the Spotify release. They're

975
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:54,870
like, shows. stash something as
my this pot podcast of 2020.

976
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:58,950
Oh, yeah. Now lists. Of course.
I'll have to ask devore act

977
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:02,160
explain again, how these lists
are made in corporate America.

978
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,380
It's hilarious. It's a lunch
basically.

979
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:10,890
If you Okay, so we had a we did
a one clip of this show last

980
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:17,430
week with Dan Benjamin. And if
we're out here on the outside,

981
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:20,070
we're outside of Spotify
ecosystem. We can't get to the

982
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,040
you know, we can't listen to the
Spotify exclusives. Yeah,

983
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:28,470
they're all locked behind the
silo past a wall. If you want a

984
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:34,260
taste of what you're missing, of
how good the quality of

985
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:41,970
exclusive shows is. Clip two as
a shoe is is a show with Addison

986
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:47,250
Ray, who is the number two
earning tik tok influencer.

987
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,750
Oh my,

988
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:52,260
I think she's like 1819 years
old, something like that.

989
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,380
That's according to yet another
list.

990
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:56,700
Yes, yes.

991
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,150
Yes. By the way, people these
lists are crap. You know that,

992
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:03,360
right? Like these lists are
compiled according to interests

993
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:06,600
involved in the list? People?

994
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,370
conception

995
01:03:08,399 --> 01:03:11,309
Yeah, of course, this list is
very Yes. It's the list of

996
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:12,089
lists. Exactly.

997
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:17,010
By the way, the tick tock thing
is, and like when I should be

998
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:21,420
more specific, and not just a
thing, the TIC Tock culture

999
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:27,150
amongst top influencers is very
weird. Oh, it's gonna it's gonna

1000
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:30,930
get old. Did you? Have you seen
this stuff where they have some

1001
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:35,790
sort of like company that rents
mansions to top Tick tock, of

1002
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:41,070
course. So that's their set. Man
that is? Oh, yeah. So whole

1003
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:46,950
industry. Yeah. But it's all
based on one of the basic sins

1004
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,720
vanity. Yeah.

1005
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:52,680
So Oh, well, we'll then that
play clip too. So let's see

1006
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:55,950
here. What you're what we're all
missing. Oh, Mom. Let's

1007
01:03:55,950 --> 01:04:01,110
fill everyone in on my 20th
birthday. So my 20th birthday.

1008
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:06,120
Big number because 20 is no
longer a teenager. My friend

1009
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:10,530
Bryant set up a kind of like a
little birthday dinner for me.

1010
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:15,360
You know, it was really sweet.
And we went to a restaurant. We

1011
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,330
all sat at like, small tables.
It was like four people at each

1012
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:21,960
table. Really small event.
Probably there was like 12

1013
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:24,720
people there. But there was only
four people at each table. Plus

1014
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,060
my family. My mom and dad and
brothers were there. So it

1015
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,590
wasn't really like a lot of
people.

1016
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,390
This is some exclusive stuff
there.

1017
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:34,890
But we all kind of just sat they
wrote little notes on like these

1018
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:39,450
cards. I got to read them when I
got home. And then we cut the

1019
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:42,570
cake. Oh, I do much besides eat
that was it. We weren't like

1020
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:44,460
steaming up and like dancing or
anything. It was just like a

1021
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:47,610
restaurant. You know? So we the
French Laundry with gaffers.

1022
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:54,420
Yeah, the candles. I blew up my
birthday candles. I had so many

1023
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:57,570
cakes on my birthday. The best
one was the one Courtney got me

1024
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,700
to flower one from flower

1025
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,810
I am just realizing we're doing
this podcast all wrong. Dave. We

1026
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,270
should be talking more like
this. So when we talk about the

1027
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:10,560
namespace, you know, it's just
namespace, but we didn't have a

1028
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:13,650
you know, we have location
issues and issues problematic.

1029
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:16,530
problematic the namespace
especially when it comes to

1030
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:17,370
location.

1031
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:19,290
It was so good the heart one

1032
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:19,980
yeah, that was

1033
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:26,400
really tastes like cream cheese
icing. Oh, but the entire cake

1034
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,080
is cream cheese. Oh, wasn't it?
Yeah, it was mushy like it was

1035
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:36,510
like fondant and cream cheese
icing mixed together into a mix

1036
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:40,560
with a little bit of cake. So
good. It was so pretty. And it

1037
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,380
was beautiful. Yeah. And I kind
of liked the crunchy outside of

1038
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:43,470
the

1039
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:48,750
day. Yeah, that

1040
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,900
was the best cake ever. But the
view the view at your birthday

1041
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:58,740
was amazing on that. I was so
pretty. Yeah. So my favorite

1042
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:05,400
gift I got was probably either
the stage or stop. Really? Yeah,

1043
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,290
it was a really good gift
actually. Because it was

1044
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:07,800
thoughtful.

1045
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:08,340
It was It

1046
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,710
was great. I guess a

1047
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:13,950
nice gift. Yes. Overall, it was
a really good birthday. I think

1048
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:15,420
this is one of my best birthdays
yet.

1049
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,630
Wait a minute. Wait a minute,
Dave. Let me just fix myself

1050
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:25,500
here. Feel better now shot
myself.

1051
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:33,240
Yeah, so after you go rinse your
brain out with soap. That is

1052
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,530
okay. So I went through and
listened to some shows on there

1053
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:42,570
over the last few weeks. And
they're all this way. They're

1054
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:48,630
also boring. They're just
boring. Yeah. I can't explain it

1055
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:52,080
any other way. So if you listen
to the same thing with Bernie

1056
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,960
Brown, we played some of her
first shows before before she

1057
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,940
went exclusive. So then I went
back and I listened to her

1058
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:03,510
exclusive show. And it's boring.
And it's something about like,

1059
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,380
there must be something
psychological about guaranteed

1060
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:12,540
money, losing control of your
content script being scripted.

1061
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,540
All this stuff that makes your
stuff boring.

1062
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,190
Yep. Yeah.

1063
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,840
What's the message to the way
your take your cake tastes?

1064
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:26,280
I mean, this is why I have no
issue with what Spotify is

1065
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:31,170
doing. Yeah, keep doing caitli
can't do more of it. I go back.

1066
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:33,180
And look, there's a million
examples of this. I'm going to

1067
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:36,300
give it one more time the
America Online example. It was a

1068
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,120
safe, well protected, but you
can get a little risque here and

1069
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:42,330
there. Oh, yes. This is a great
place to be You've Got Mail,

1070
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:46,860
huh. But then people heard about
this thing called the internet.

1071
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:51,510
And out there somewhere is all
the dangerous stuff, all the

1072
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:55,530
cool stuff. We want that AOL and
AOL but grudgingly said, Well,

1073
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:58,890
okay. But you have to click on
these five screens to say I

1074
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:02,820
understand the risk of using a
browser. And people use the

1075
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:06,660
browser and they found the porn,
and they never came back. And it

1076
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,220
will became a dial up company.

1077
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,860
If you took their son, so when
we get ready for this show you,

1078
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,830
you know, we're like, okay, Hey,
what's up, blah, blah, blah,

1079
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,920
alright, kick it in. And we just
start recording and everything

1080
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,130
just comes out? Well, I mean, if
we were to take this show and

1081
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:26,610
stick it into Spotify, and put a
Folgers commercial at the

1082
01:08:26,610 --> 01:08:31,110
beginning, and then a mid roll
for, you know, Prudential live,

1083
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,770
I don't know, I'm just making
crap up. I mean, like, and then

1084
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:36,660
you say, Okay, we have this
segment, we're gonna talk about

1085
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,370
this. In this segment, we're
gonna talk about this. It's

1086
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:41,940
like, it just loses any sense of
entertainment whatsoever.

1087
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:45,810
Well, it's all subjective. And
I'm sure there's a there's a

1088
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:48,660
market for the for these
podcasts, otherwise, they

1089
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:52,500
wouldn't be investing in it. But
the world is big. And while

1090
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,630
we're on that, there's two
things. Well, there's three

1091
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:58,890
things we need to do. We thank
some people. But also we were

1092
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:00,780
going to give some stat, why
don't we thank some people.

1093
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,970
First, I want to run through
some stats with you, which will

1094
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:09,450
take us into the final wrap up
of lightning and value block.

1095
01:09:10,199 --> 01:09:10,709
Yeah, sure.

1096
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:18,809
See here. Okay. stack of paper,
get some good donations.

1097
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:22,620
I'd like to remind everybody
that we operate under the value

1098
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:26,640
for value system with the entire
podcast index.org project.

1099
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:30,120
David, no one, none of the three
partners including Eric, we

1100
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:33,870
don't take salary. We don't know
if it'll ever come to that. But

1101
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:38,610
the index does run on the value
that we receive from the people

1102
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:43,140
who have who perceive the value
of what we're doing. That is

1103
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:47,460
sometimes developers it's fans
of podcasts as podcasters it's

1104
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:50,190
people who understand and like
technology and like seeing

1105
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:55,500
things move forward. And all we
ask is that you consider how

1106
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:59,460
valuable this is to you. There's
no other charge for the use the

1107
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:04,980
index shared, the API is open.
We're, we're clearly putting

1108
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:08,040
time and effort and energy into
it. So all we ask for in return

1109
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,280
is some value. It could be time
talent, treasure. Now you see

1110
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:15,390
the developers, what they're
putting into it is, of course,

1111
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:19,350
astronomical. But we also have
people who just need to support

1112
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:22,500
us financially. And we love
thanking them because often a

1113
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:26,250
recurring donation can mean an
entire server that runs to

1114
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,190
complete the mission of
preserving podcasting as a

1115
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:32,490
platform for free speech and
retooling it into a platform of

1116
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:34,560
value for everyone,

1117
01:10:35,489 --> 01:10:39,719
like the pod pod, calculate the
value perception, their

1118
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:43,259
reception for perception. I know
I just I just came up with that.

1119
01:10:43,259 --> 01:10:44,339
Yes. Yeah.

1120
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:49,440
These are some little things
some value perception engineers,

1121
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,490
how about today? You go,

1122
01:10:50,939 --> 01:10:56,759

third of our hosting fees for

future as an open medium of

1142
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,900

mo nation. Because I got I got
people who live there.

1145

With this btn That one goes with
that one. Okay.

1146
01:12:15,989 --> 01:12:18,419
Here it is. I'm not hearing you
crumple them up and throw them

1147
01:12:18,419 --> 01:12:21,779
on the floor like he usually do.
Am I not? I didn't hear it.

1148
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,090
No. Crumpler, okay.

1149
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:27,210
folder, your risk cruncher.

1150
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:32,070
Somebody gave us a donation.
This is this is a one time pick

1151
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:36,960
paper crinkle sound donation. I
really enjoy the sound Keep up

1152
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,990
the good work. As a podcast
listener, I would benefit from a

1153
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:44,070
list of podcasts that are using
2.0 features and tags so that I

1154
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:47,640
can check them out. Awesome to
every podcast that Adam is on at

1155
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:53,550
one point to speed and I refuse
to stop. He says r&b dance.

1156
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,460
All right, all right.

1157
01:12:56,489 --> 01:13:00,089
I'm not. I'm not trying to rush
through episodes. It just sounds

1158
01:13:00,089 --> 01:13:03,329
more natural to me how he
sounded Luke. Okay, so Luke,

1159
01:13:04,139 --> 01:13:09,959
where's Luke? Yeah, I'm just out
of control. Like

1160
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,100
your code, actually.

1161
01:13:11,699 --> 01:13:20,519
Hey, that hurts. Okay. Luke gave
us $10 Luke Presley. Luke,

1162
01:13:20,519 --> 01:13:21,329
here's your

1163
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,590
nice paper.

1164
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,830
very satisfying. All right.
Then.

1165
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:42,000
The next one we got here. Oh,
this is $20 donation from Yorn.

1166
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:49,350
And he just have note. I don't
see one where now it looks like

1167
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:54,990
it's just a $20 donation. All
right. Thank you. Yorn. Shar,

1168
01:13:55,200 --> 01:14:00,900
thank you. You're. And then we
have there's a good note here

1169
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:11,610
from David Metis. He, he did a
$10 month subscription. And he

1170
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:15,720
says, David Adam, hey, this is
Metis rounds. No, I'm sorry.

1171
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:19,620
metus rounds. What he says
rounds with fetus. Yeah. Got it.

1172
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:25,350
Okay. From this is a mitas from
Fun fact, Friday with Lila and

1173
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:29,100
David. Oh, hello. And this is
great. He says I heard y'all

1174
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:32,100
lost a $10 a month donor. So I
decided we should replace it for

1175
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:32,280
you.

1176
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:34,860
Ah, that's fantastic. In that
sweet?

1177
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:38,520
Yeah, in my very long term goals
are to be a full time value for

1178
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:44,490
value podcaster vow of poverty.
I know. I want to ensure that

1179
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:47,310
there's a place for independent
podcasters and the big companies

1180
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:50,460
don't set a lock us all out.
Well. Now I got to figure out

1181
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:53,700
how to get all of this code
implemented in my feet weekend

1182
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:54,300
project.

1183
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:59,550
Fantastic. And if you were the
host, now we have to go to new

1184
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:04,470
podcast. apps.com new podcast
apps calm. There's a list there

1185
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:08,220
of apps that support the 2.0
features in you can search for

1186
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:12,720
by function and also the hosting
companies who support this and

1187
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:17,040
hosting applications because
cost apart I think, is there an

1188
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,240
app application?

1189
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:22,680
Yeah. And that was fun fact,
Friday looks like the name of

1190
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:23,280
his podcast.

1191
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:26,160
Nice. Get a roll and brother get
some SATs.

1192
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,430
So here's a I guess this one was
out of order. This was a

1193
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:36,750
Christopher Tomkinson gave us
$50 single time, one time

1194
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:40,140
donation. Nice. And his message
was rock on gas.

1195
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:47,760
back at you, right on. We commit
to rocking Yes. For those about

1196
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,230
to rock We salute you.

1197
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:55,260
And finally, we get a new
automatic, monthly subscription

1198
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:58,800
from Kevin Rola for $5 a month
and I could not find a note from

1199
01:15:58,800 --> 01:15:59,160
Kevin.

1200
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:02,130
Kevin, I think is a no agenda
guy.

1201
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:04,410
I think his name sounds good.
Yeah, does.

1202
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,100
Thank you, guys, very nice.

1203
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:11,190
And that is it. So those are the
donors.

1204
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,220
But listen, hold on a second.
I'm sorry. Because before it

1205
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:17,550
scrolls off, I'm looking at the
no agenda troll room. And I see

1206
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:21,510
people chatting, I use regex to
change season and episode stuff

1207
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:25,950
on video files. And it's like,
well, it's because iTunes is

1208
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:28,380
messed up and like, well, at
least they're working on a

1209
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:29,220
namespace.

1210
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:30,330
Yeah,

1211
01:16:30,330 --> 01:16:33,510
just talking about us right in
the chat room. And this is

1212
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:35,640
completely unrelated. They're
not listening to us.

1213
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:38,400
It's not on the stream. No, no,
no, not at all. Not at all.

1214
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:43,200
That's funny. So that was the
donations from what we call

1215
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:46,020
this. Fiat donations that

1216
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:50,910
are made. These are all fee
donations that come through our

1217
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:56,010
PayPal. Now we do have a
lightning widget a podcast

1218
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:59,850
index.org. And you can use that
or just click on that big red

1219
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:03,510
Donate button. It's red for a
reason, people. And if you're

1220
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:05,970
listening to this show, and
you're listening right now,

1221
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:10,320
still the Sphinx chat app, crank
up those value sliders, hundred

1222
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:15,390
sets a minute, keep it common,
boom. 11 most most.

1223
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:21,720
Okay, so we got lightning stats.
We've had almost a full month of

1224
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:22,350
lightning.

1225
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,850
Three weeks, or it's almost not
quite four weeks, I don't think

1226
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:30,000
have we? Well, the report I ran
was for November, and we only

1227
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,950
have three weeks in November.

1228
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:35,400
Yeah. It started in the November
11. Mm hmm. So he Okay, that

1229
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,950
makes it. Alright, so this for
three weeks from the 11th

1230
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:41,790
through the end of the month,
what I found interesting, it'll

1231
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:44,610
say, Well, if you just add up
the dollar value of all the SATs

1232
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:48,480
from per minute, I didn't
include like, boosts or anything

1233
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,850
like that. I just thought these
were more interesting. per

1234
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:57,930
minute, SATs, they hit the index
node that's then as 1%. The

1235
01:17:57,930 --> 01:18:02,220
total dollar value of those SATs
is $7 and 50 cents.

1236
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,360
That's without the boosts
without the boost. Yes. And with

1237
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,430
the boosts because I think boost
is a part of it.

1238
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:11,400
Yeah, I don't have in front of
me. for it, I

1239
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,190
think it goes up to $11 11.

1240
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,950
Okay, double digits. Well,

1241
01:18:16,949 --> 01:18:19,949
this is important because this
is so just to explain what we're

1242
01:18:19,949 --> 01:18:23,999
talking about here. On the
Sphinx chat app that have

1243
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:27,539
implemented the value block with
the lightning nodes, lightning,

1244
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:31,709
lightning IDs, and the splits,
please see the sexy namespace

1245
01:18:31,709 --> 01:18:40,109
for more details. It's very sexy
namespace of each minute

1246
01:18:40,169 --> 01:18:45,149
listened. 1% goes to the Sphynx
chat app, which will be our

1247
01:18:45,149 --> 01:18:48,659
standard default. For the app
that you're listening to

1248
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:53,789
listening to the podcast on 1%

1249
01:18:53,789 --> 01:18:57,029
to the podcast. And all of this
is voluntary, any podcaster can

1250
01:18:57,029 --> 01:19:01,499
change these, these splits and
these destinations at will in

1251
01:19:01,499 --> 01:19:08,849
their. In their RSS feed, we
suggest a portion for the app

1252
01:19:08,849 --> 01:19:13,019
and for the index because its
value for value. And all the

1253
01:19:13,019 --> 01:19:15,299
other stuff you can cut up
amongst your buddies, your

1254
01:19:15,299 --> 01:19:19,079
friends, your co host, whatever
you want. So when 100 satoshis

1255
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:24,689
goes through 1% goes to the app
1% goes to the index. So the

1256
01:19:24,749 --> 01:19:31,049
overall value flow in three
weeks has been about $1,000 has

1257
01:19:31,049 --> 01:19:36,689
been transmitted while enjoying
podcasts, either playing them in

1258
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:42,839
real time. Or, or enjoying extra
pieces in boosting. Am I saying

1259
01:19:42,839 --> 01:19:44,159
that right? Yeah,

1260
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,739
I think so. So you could say
well, if you're only talking

1261
01:19:46,739 --> 01:19:51,869
about per minutes and not boost,
then roughly $750 has floated

1262
01:19:51,899 --> 01:19:52,799
flow through the system.

1263
01:19:52,949 --> 01:19:56,429
That's I mean, and that's what
six podcasts. Yeah,

1264
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:00,450
well and Okay, so the more
interesting aspect of To me,

1265
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:02,640
then they didn't even the money
part was the number of

1266
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:08,640
transactions. Then there was
12,160 minutes of podcast

1267
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:13,080
listening through Sphinx. In
three weeks, that translates

1268
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,300
into 202 hours of listening,

1269
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:22,110
which is how many days? Gosh,
four days?

1270
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:28,020
Not me. 72 hours, three days, so
roughly

1271
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:34,860
200 Yes, of course, almost eight
910 days. So holy crap

1272
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,970
worth of worth of podcasts time
spent listening. Now, that's

1273
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:41,550
what i said i excluded the
boost. So that's only per

1274
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:47,160
minute. Split transactions. So
that's an accurate count of

1275
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:52,590
there. There was 202 hours of
podcasts listens to through

1276
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:53,400
Sphinx chat.

1277
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,650
So we're gonna start surfacing
this number.

1278
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:57,180
Yeah. On the side.

1279
01:20:57,330 --> 01:21:03,420
Yeah. Because that is so sexy
$1,000 has been running through

1280
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,880
just a handful of podcasts.

1281
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:09,900
Yeah, it's really only a, it's
just a few. I mean, like,

1282
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:10,410
there's,

1283
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:15,510
and, and, you know, so, okay,
here's my experience with this,

1284
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:23,070
because this is blowing my mind.
It's, it's gotten so regular,

1285
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:27,150
that and that, you know, I use
Thunder hub for the index

1286
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:29,640
lightning node, and you can see
a running, you know, it's kind

1287
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:33,390
of like a feed of when a payment
comes in. And it'll tell you

1288
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:36,240
know, how many seconds ago how
many minutes ago how many hours

1289
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:40,680
ago, and more often than not,
I'll see three payments. And

1290
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:45,600
it's just the 1%, three payments
come in, at the same timestamp,

1291
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:50,820
or within the same minute. But
it's always one always doesn't

1292
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:54,300
matter. When I watch when I look
almost always and then all of a

1293
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:58,710
sudden, the other day, I think
two days ago, all payments

1294
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:03,510
stopped around 4pm Central Time,
and didn't really start again

1295
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:07,050
until 11. And I got freaked out.
I'm like, something, something

1296
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:11,460
cuz i, this is what I do. I
analyze trends. And I've kind of

1297
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:14,280
a neural networking capability,
like, something's wrong

1298
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,780
texted me, you're like what,
hey,

1299
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:22,950
something went wrong. Now, we
think that a channel got full

1300
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:27,120
and closed. And I do have some
evidence of that on my node. So

1301
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:31,080
it might have been an outbound
outbound channel that just got

1302
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:34,650
exhausted and wasn't, you know,
autopilot didn't do its job for

1303
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:37,710
those who understand. And there
was no other route or something

1304
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:41,130
like that. But that's how
regular these payments are. So

1305
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:45,390
imagine you have an app, and you
just see money coming in, in the

1306
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:50,610
form of satoshis every minute of
the day, multiple entries. And

1307
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:56,250
then just imagine what we have
to do as a group to magnify that

1308
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,600
and multiply it times 1000.
Yeah, well, now all of a sudden,

1309
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,810
we're all in business. And,
again, I'll run through the

1310
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:06,720
numbers. 100 million people in
America, listen to one hour of

1311
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:11,430
podcasts a day, we convert 1% of
those hundred million people to

1312
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:16,080
donate or pledge and use one of
the apps that were that are

1313
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:20,250
lightning enabled. It's a
million dollars a day flowing to

1314
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:24,870
the ecosystem gets your slice of
it today. And while stocks last.

1315
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:30,240
And I'm very happy to say that
I've had ongoing conversations

1316
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:35,970
with Roy scheinfeld from breeze
wallet. And those guys are a

1317
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:41,070
heads down and they are they are
working on integrating

1318
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:45,030
podcasting into their wallet. I
think I think they may even

1319
01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:48,390
release it just as a podcast app
that happens to have a wallet.

1320
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:50,670
That would be the ultimate I
think

1321
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,960
we we talked a little bit about
that in Frederick show they did

1322
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:59,700
I understand correctly that they
have that they're going to do a

1323
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,870
release like a skeleton app or
the source code for that.

1324
01:24:03,989 --> 01:24:07,439
Yeah, they will. Okay, yeah, the
integration for it so they've

1325
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:10,349
already the the breeze wallet
code is already on GitHub and

1326
01:24:10,349 --> 01:24:14,249
available. So that gets they're
gonna create rappers and stuff.

1327
01:24:15,089 --> 01:24:19,019
And I believe they're all doing
it in HTML or maybe even react.

1328
01:24:19,019 --> 01:24:21,059
I don't know what the hell
they're using. I need

1329
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:24,960
to get back with Paul and Evan
overs Thanks and see and we

1330
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,510
can't talk to those guys. And
well, we need to, but he didn't

1331
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:29,760
hook up and have a meeting with
them. And just see where

1332
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,610
everything's at. What No, no,
no, no, no, no,

1333
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:33,749
no. Dave What

1334
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:37,950
are you talking about? We need
to bring him on the show. Oh,

1335
01:24:37,950 --> 01:24:44,580
yeah. Idiot. Yes. Boost boost.
You get a boost sound.

1336
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,610
Verbal boost. Yeah. We need him.

1337
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:50,790
Let me see if I can get a boost
to sound away.

1338
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:54,270
There's There's got to be an
audible boost on the because

1339
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:55,200
this is too fun.

1340
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:57,930
Let's see boost sound effects
Hold on a second. Let me see

1341
01:24:57,930 --> 01:25:02,130
what I got here. Central.
mucking around anyway. Let's

1342
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:08,250
just see if I got a boost in
this. I need to boost. Yes.

1343
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,070
Boost baby. Yeah.

1344
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:20,580
What was that? preview? Yeah,
yeah, we need we need to we need

1345
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:24,150
to get Jennifer Buchanan to do a
boost sound at the top of it

1346
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:28,770
you've boosted? Yes I'm like
that That's awesome.

1347
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:36,119
Yes. So now the beauty of what
they're working on is they have

1348
01:25:36,119 --> 01:25:40,709
an app that is that is I think
it's a neutrino app. So it's a

1349
01:25:40,709 --> 01:25:45,329
very lightweight Bitcoin
lightning node that functions by

1350
01:25:45,329 --> 01:25:52,079
itself and has keys and outbound
enabled. So in order to receive

1351
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:54,929
satoshis, you need to have
something that's online all the

1352
01:25:54,929 --> 01:25:58,559
time. But to send them you only
have to be connected to be able

1353
01:25:58,559 --> 01:26:05,069
to send to whatever the whatever
receiving node is programmed for

1354
01:26:05,069 --> 01:26:09,539
the for the value split. So this
scales infinitely, at least

1355
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:12,089
until we break the lightning
network, but it scales

1356
01:26:12,119 --> 01:26:17,909
infinitely for people to use.
And, and yeah, so even if

1357
01:26:17,909 --> 01:26:23,309
you're, if you're a podcaster
maybe have a look@voltage.io or

1358
01:26:23,309 --> 01:26:26,699
raspy Blitz or Sphinx chat for
me, you can use that perfectly

1359
01:26:26,699 --> 01:26:29,549
fine to use a node that you have
over there to receive your

1360
01:26:29,549 --> 01:26:30,449
satoshis on

1361
01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:34,260
did a voltage node light node
this past week?

1362
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:37,800
Yeah, experience was great.
Yeah, not fantastic.

1363
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:40,440
Mm hmm. Once the light node
works fine. Yeah.

1364
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:44,340
I got the full blown big note. I
didn't know at the time, just

1365
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:46,950
like I'll just take the big note
because I figured we got big

1366
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:49,260
stuff coming in. Well, I almost
wanted to I

1367
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:51,270
almost did the big node then I
was like, you know, I want to

1368
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:54,420
get the light neutrino node just
for a test run to see how it

1369
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:57,570
works. Right. So far. It's been
good rock solid. Yeah,

1370
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:58,170
excellent.

1371
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,920
Yeah. Yeah. Good over there. I
like it.

1372
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:05,700
By the way, you know, we were
talking about we talked a little

1373
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:07,350
bit about substack. Last week.

1374
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:09,000
We agreed, yeah.

1375
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:16,830
How they felt like how they do
fees. Mm hmm. I found there's a

1376
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:21,120
really good article called the
substack irati. From the

1377
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:27,420
Columbia Journalism Review, and
it's says in here that they take

1378
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:33,810
10% Yeah, it says the guys
devised, guys she's referring

1379
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:38,580
Guys, guys, is the guys that
started. By the way, it's very

1380
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:39,960
interesting article if you if
you're

1381
01:27:39,989 --> 01:27:41,639
putting it in the show notes
right now.

1382
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:48,750
And it's worth a full res very
long, but it's worth reading it

1383
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:53,670
for a lot of different reasons.
So the Clio,

1384
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:55,200
the Clio Chang article.

1385
01:27:55,439 --> 01:27:58,739
Yes, exactly. Right. Now part of
the part of this article feels

1386
01:27:58,859 --> 01:28:07,409
feels different feels defensive
of the J squad. The It feels

1387
01:28:07,409 --> 01:28:13,589
like a journalist trying to
contain one. Yeah, yeah. But

1388
01:28:13,589 --> 01:28:16,379
there's also political Anyway,
there's this very interesting

1389
01:28:16,379 --> 01:28:21,599
article, but she she says that
this is the guys talking about

1390
01:28:21,599 --> 01:28:26,279
the founders of substack devised
a system of taking a 10% cut

1391
01:28:26,279 --> 01:28:29,399
from subscriptions. stripe, the
credit card service that

1392
01:28:29,399 --> 01:28:34,739
processes the fees would take an
X would take 2.9% plus 30 cents

1393
01:28:34,739 --> 01:28:41,489
per transaction, which they felt
tied down to the riders. Ah, so

1394
01:28:41,759 --> 01:28:46,979
I don't it's a little difficult
to decipher issue means 10% cut

1395
01:28:47,069 --> 01:28:52,769
and in stripe is an additional
2.9%. Or, I'm not sure how they

1396
01:28:52,799 --> 01:28:57,119
But anyways, 10% and then
minimum, perhaps 12.9%. So I

1397
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:01,739
don't know. But that's not it,
so that you do that compared to

1398
01:29:03,269 --> 01:29:09,659
compared to the value block. And
there's there's potentially

1399
01:29:09,659 --> 01:29:12,749
nothing if you don't want it to
be or you know, if you're

1400
01:29:12,779 --> 01:29:16,259
stingy. Or if you want to you
know, if you're willing to split

1401
01:29:16,259 --> 01:29:21,959
out some for other things like
the podcast app, and the index

1402
01:29:21,959 --> 01:29:24,599
or, you know, all these other
things. There's there's other

1403
01:29:24,599 --> 01:29:28,079
ways to slice it, but it's
definitely well south of 10%.

1404
01:29:28,590 --> 01:29:30,330
Oh, no kidding. No kidding.

1405
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:33,930
Oh, my good not to worry about
being d platformed. It's

1406
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,750
cheaper, and you don't have to
worry about D platform.

1407
01:29:37,529 --> 01:29:44,489
And it helps create an
ecosystem. Yeah. Yep. It really

1408
01:29:44,489 --> 01:29:49,859
does. And I think if only if we
start with the, with lightning

1409
01:29:49,859 --> 01:29:54,059
payments for work that's being
done and for value splits and

1410
01:29:54,059 --> 01:29:57,899
credits, you know, it it's
priming the pump, and I'm just

1411
01:29:57,899 --> 01:30:01,019
seeing this the this machine is
rolling it Is it is just

1412
01:30:01,019 --> 01:30:05,129
running. It's like, as an
entrepreneur, there's different

1413
01:30:05,129 --> 01:30:09,059
moments in it. And I've started
several companies and taken one

1414
01:30:09,059 --> 01:30:12,389
public. And so there's all these
moments that you kind of come to

1415
01:30:12,389 --> 01:30:16,319
recognize. And when all of a
sudden, you spin the wheel and

1416
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:20,369
the flywheel keeps going. And
this is an incredible moment,

1417
01:30:20,369 --> 01:30:23,879
and that's what's taking place
here. The flywheel is spinning

1418
01:30:23,909 --> 01:30:28,139
in perpetual motion by itself.
Okay, we had some kind of slow

1419
01:30:28,139 --> 01:30:33,539
down the other day between 4pm
and 11pm. But the thing is

1420
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:38,009
spinning, it's really happening.
And all we need is just more

1421
01:30:38,009 --> 01:30:41,459
apps to support this. And the
podcasters. And everything will

1422
01:30:41,459 --> 01:30:45,479
come I mean, the Bitcoin guys,
they're having a ball. Yeah,

1423
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:49,649
Bitcoin podcasts aren't the
jack, Jack's man. It's

1424
01:30:49,649 --> 01:30:50,849
fantastic. Yeah,

1425
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:54,210
there's so I looked it up,
there's 10 podcasts total, with

1426
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:58,140
a block enabled in the index so
far. So if he didn't match, you

1427
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:02,490
just imagine, you know, if you
go, you know, if you multiply

1428
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:08,880
that, that times, you know, if
you go up to 100, podcasts, we

1429
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,430
know what they're doing, you're
talking about, all of a sudden,

1430
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:15,720
you that's meaningful money that
begins to support, like, for our

1431
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:20,010
standpoint, begins to support.
Let's just go up to 1000

1432
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:24,270
podcasts. Now you're talking
about 70 $700 a month. Now

1433
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:27,270
you're talking about being able
to cover all the hosting fees,

1434
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:32,280
all of our stuff. Yep. All of
the infrastructure with 1000

1435
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:37,530
podcasts. And that's, that's at
1%. And if the app takes 1% now

1436
01:31:37,530 --> 01:31:40,890
the app guys are getting paid.
Significant. Yeah. I mean, a

1437
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:44,700
decent amount of money. I mean,
like, that's what, there's no,

1438
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:49,230
if you take somebody like hyper
catcher, I'd love to he would

1439
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:53,520
love to be getting $500 a month.
Sure. And he can get it he can

1440
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,350
get it being worth his time.

1441
01:31:55,380 --> 01:32:00,180
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Anyway, no,
so we'll publish that. I think

1442
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:03,750
we also should add to the new
podcast apps, maybe someone we

1443
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:06,210
have to surface I know you've
made an endpoint for it. We need

1444
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:10,260
to surface the value block
enabled the shows

1445
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:13,439
yet Trent is redoing the
website. Ah,

1446
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,390
drug Play Doh to the rescue.

1447
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:20,460
Yeah, I had a GSE meeting with
him the other day. And a great

1448
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:21,090
guy, man.

1449
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:23,880
Oh, no, I've had coffee with him
here in town. He's a fabulous

1450
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:24,210
guy.

1451
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:25,710
He's in Austin. Hester.

1452
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:29,160
Yeah, he's, uh, he recently
moved here. You know, he's, he's

1453
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:32,430
like, younger than my daughter.
But you wouldn't know it. I

1454
01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:35,730
mean, the guy is just like wood.
He's very worldly, super smart,

1455
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:38,460
and very, very talented. He's,

1456
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:39,360
he's an old soul.

1457
01:32:39,389 --> 01:32:41,189
Mm hmm. There you go. That's it.

1458
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:45,600
Yeah, but he's, he's redoing the
website. And so he's just, it's

1459
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,270
not gonna be a major change. But
he's just like restructuring it

1460
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:51,270
and reformatting some stuff. So
I'm gonna let him finish that

1461
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:55,740
first, before I make any big
changes to it. And then once he

1462
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:58,770
gets that done, then I'm going
to put up the do the feats page

1463
01:32:58,770 --> 01:32:59,190
and all that.

1464
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:03,570
So let's get you Paul on Evan
from Smith's chat for next week

1465
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:06,630
if they can make it. Well, we
already got next week. Oh, who

1466
01:33:06,630 --> 01:33:08,700
do we have next week? next week.
Dave?

1467
01:33:09,510 --> 01:33:12,510
The guests from transistor. Oh,
cool.

1468
01:33:12,570 --> 01:33:14,730
Okay. All right. Don't do it
after them. Do we have another

1469
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:15,870
week before Christmas?

1470
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:18,630
We got to figure out what to do
about Christmas because

1471
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:22,620
Christmas Friday falls on the
25th it is Christmas Day. So we

1472
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:24,300
need to pre record something I
think.

1473
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:30,420
Yeah, well, I don't know. Yeah,
we'll think of we'll think of

1474
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:35,490
what to do. I wonder if we could
get James Cridland on for? Let's

1475
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:38,130
see if it's Christmas for us.
It'll be New Year's in

1476
01:33:38,130 --> 01:33:39,870
Australia. So

1477
01:33:40,739 --> 01:33:41,609
yeah.

1478
01:33:42,479 --> 01:33:45,839
I'd love to have James on. I'd
very much want to have James.

1479
01:33:45,839 --> 01:33:46,349
Okay.

1480
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:51,480
So let's say 6pm. His time isn't
known. 6pm Our time is 9am his

1481
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:51,720
time?

1482
01:33:51,809 --> 01:33:53,279
Oh, well. We can do it at 6pm.

1483
01:33:54,059 --> 01:33:57,329
Yeah, the ethics. Especially if
it's an off day. Yeah, it is not

1484
01:33:57,329 --> 01:33:59,579
a Friday. Yeah, we can do that.

1485
01:34:01,409 --> 01:34:08,849
We'll work on James but so we
got a transistor next week. And

1486
01:34:08,849 --> 01:34:11,069
then can we do Paul and Evan, I
want to get ball on Amazon.

1487
01:34:11,189 --> 01:34:14,189
The week after? Yeah, yeah. If
you think and then

1488
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:16,230
you mean my wine.

1489
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:21,660
Okay, we can

1490
01:34:22,859 --> 01:34:23,909
talk namespace

1491
01:34:23,910 --> 01:34:29,010
when you have to clean your room
first. My room is clean as a

1492
01:34:29,010 --> 01:34:32,190
whistle. It is man. That picture
your studio was bombed.

1493
01:34:32,489 --> 01:34:36,059
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I realized
later that people look at like,

1494
01:34:36,089 --> 01:34:39,239
oh, okay, it looks cool. But
they don't really understand.

1495
01:34:39,419 --> 01:34:42,719
This is custom made for me for
the way I set up my gear which

1496
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:47,459
is portable. So I mean, it's,
it's, it's so perfect. I'm so

1497
01:34:47,459 --> 01:34:48,119
happy here.

1498
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:51,929
Now. I like that they is this
LED string lights.

1499
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:56,160
That's the cheapest addition to
my studio and I have little

1500
01:34:56,160 --> 01:35:00,000
remote control. So I like the
blue kind of purplish blue.

1501
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:06,090
harem look when I'm doing now
often when I do show I'll, I'll

1502
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:10,050
do a little orange to get it
because it gives you energy. And

1503
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:12,210
you can do it all you can do it
all from from the remote

1504
01:35:12,210 --> 01:35:15,870
control. That was literally like
20 bucks before the stream in

1505
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:18,750
there all the time all the time.
Yeah, I'm Uh, I'm the guy that

1506
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:22,740
has the dark studio. I don't
want the outside in. So I can

1507
01:35:22,830 --> 01:35:28,080
totally my, my space right now
is the screen in front of me to

1508
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,750
the left is where I see your
meter go up and down that

1509
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:34,140
represents you. And to the right
is jingles or, you know, like

1510
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:37,650
this stuff. And I'm just in my
little world, man. I don't see

1511
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:38,730
anything outside of it. I

1512
01:35:38,730 --> 01:35:42,840
love it. That's perfect. I'm
currently podcasting from my

1513
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:45,900
hallway. I'm in the flub sitting
in the floor.

1514
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:48,060
This is one of your better
studios.

1515
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:48,690
It

1516
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:53,250
sounds very good. I'm very nice.
And I got a lot less of the fire

1517
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:54,480
truck going by this time.

1518
01:35:54,779 --> 01:35:59,129
Yeah. I'm perfectly enclosed in
here now. It's it knows good.

1519
01:35:59,399 --> 01:36:05,969
Yeah. So like, and I've also got
Todd and I talked to Mike. Mike

1520
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:08,519
from blueberry blueberry. Yeah,
and I've got Todd and Mike are

1521
01:36:08,519 --> 01:36:10,319
gonna be on with us in January.
Ah,

1522
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:14,519
super. Oh, man. Now we're
cooking with gas. And we got to

1523
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:19,469
get Martin on. Yes, absolutely.
Well, everybody, we need to get

1524
01:36:19,469 --> 01:36:25,529
everybody on. Party. Just like a
potty. Exactly. All right. Uh,

1525
01:36:25,559 --> 01:36:29,339
yeah. I think we've we've, we've
the board. We had a quorum, we

1526
01:36:29,339 --> 01:36:35,459
can close it out. Yes. Anything
else you need that I can conjure

1527
01:36:35,459 --> 01:36:36,359
out of air for you.

1528
01:36:36,899 --> 01:36:43,319
And I need to talk about the
Amazon outage. But another do

1529
01:36:43,319 --> 01:36:45,869
that today. We're gonna talk
about that in the next week. I

1530
01:36:45,869 --> 01:36:49,379
guess. Next time we have a non
guest we will talk about the

1531
01:36:49,379 --> 01:36:51,389
Amazon. There's a lot to learn.

1532
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:54,660
Ah, okay. Well, that is
important to do. So let's let's

1533
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:56,820
make sure we remember that
because I have my own theories

1534
01:36:56,820 --> 01:37:00,540
about the Amazon outage. Okay,
it may surprise you.

1535
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:05,820
I have a printout of their post
mortem. Ooh, that is marked up,

1536
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:08,820
but we'll save that for the next
show. Yeah, I think that's

1537
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:12,300
great. All right. Dave. Have a
great weekend. My brother, you

1538
